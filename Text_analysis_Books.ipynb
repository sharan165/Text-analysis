       "[\"meeting them at the door of his shabby apartment house, he made them a pot of black tea, and encouraged frank's curiosity about the many books he had. these lay in piles, big and small, hunkering on every horizontal surface. they were on the floor, the tables, the windowsill, the radiators -everywhere except on bookshelves (of which there were none). he was older than frank had imagined - no kid, but a man in his very late twenties. he had watery blue eyes, and a thinning head of hair that was either too long or too short for whatever it was that it was supposed to be. he wore boots and jeans and a big flannel shirt, and smiled a lot.\",\n",
       " 'frank and annie sipped their tea, sitting on the edge of a worn-out couch with a funky green slipcover. from a corner of the room the five blind boys of alabama sang jesus\\' praises through the black mesh of opposing bose speakers. \"ben\\'s brilliant,\" annie said, softening him up. \"his thesis is fantastic.\" stern chuckled. \"\"fantastic\" is right. it\\'s six hundred pages long, and i\\'m no closer to the end than i was when i began it, three years ago.\" frank winced in sympathy. \"i know the problem,\" he said. \"i\\'ve been working on the same story for months.\" \"the thing is: the more you know, the more complicated it gets - so the end keeps receding. it\\'s like zeno\\'s paradox,\" ben said, \"except it isn\\'t mathematics, it\\'s prose.\" \"annie said you\\'re writing about cults.\" stern listed from side to side, rolling his shoulders as he weighed the remarks. \"i guess so. cults, sects, new religions - what you call \"em depends on your point of view.\" \"so what\\'s your thesis?\" stern shrugged. \"\"the more things change, the more they stay the same.\"\" \"unh-huh.\" stern smiled. \"it\\'s a comparative study - the taborites and mankind united.\" frank shook his head. \"never heard of \"em.\" stern shifted uncomfortably in his chair, as if he\\'d been caught reading a ufo magazine. \"well, it\\'s apples and oranges,\" he said. \"i mean, they\\'re very different, but also... they\\'re also quite alike. the taborites were a fifteenth century religious sect in bohemia. they declared war on the priesthood, and preached a sort of proactive millenarianism.\" \"what\\'s that?\" annie asked. \"how do you -\" \"they thought it was up to them to usher in the millennium, rather than sitting around, waiting for it to happen.\" \"and how do you \"usher in the millennium\"?\" frank asked. \"you rid the world of sin. and that\\'s what they tried to do, using whatever tools they had at hand - the dagger, the pike, the catapult, the crossbow. trust me: it\\'s a good thing they didn\\'t have the bomb.\" \"so they went around killing people?\" annie asked. stern\\'s eyebrows shot up, and he fished a pack of camels from the pocket of his shirt. lighting one with a zippo, he took a long drag, and said, \"they killed sinners. hey! they were agents of the millennium. it was their job, their duty, their religious duty, to massacre anyone who wasn\\'t a part of their own movement. because that\\'s how you could tell if someone was a sinner. they didn\\'t belong. and so you killed them. and that\\'s how you cleansed the earth.\" \"jesus,\" frank said.',\n",
       " '\"exactly.\" with a mock frown, stern leaned across the steamer trunk that served as a coffee table and grabbed annie by the wrist. speaking in a malevolent whisper, leavened only by a bizarre attempt to affect a czech accent, the aging grad student muttered, \"accursed be he who withholds his sword from shedding the blood of the enemies of christ. no pity for satan, no mercy for evil. so sayeth jan the pious.\" \"wow,\" annie said, withdrawing her arm and rubbing her wrist. \"and the other guys?\" frank asked. stern looked puzzled for a moment, and then said, \"oh - you mean mankind united. they were... different.\" \"you said they were alike.\" \"well, yeah. but they were five hundred years apart, plus - whatever the distance is, psychologically, from medieval prague to depression santa monica.\" \"i should think the distance was quite large,\" frank said. \"me, too,\" annie added. \"mankind united sprang up in the early thirties,\" stern said. \"it was run by a guy named arthur bell, who spun a conspiracy theory about our secret masters,\" the \"international bankers\\' -\" uh-oh,\" frank joked, \"here come the jews.\" stern laughed. \"you\\'re right! he was a big-time anti-semite. but he was selling the millennium, too, just like the taborites. except in his case, utopia had more to do with air-conditioning than land reform.\" annie giggled. \"but he had the same idea. he said there was going to be a bloodbath, a natural catastrophe followed by an armageddonlike war that would kill - i don\\'t know how many people - most of the people - in the world. and this would be a good thing, he said, because it would usher in the new age. a.k.a. \"the millennium.\" a.k.a. \"heaven on earth.\" after the war, everyone would have free air-conditioning, a $25,000 house, and a sixteen-hour workweek - unless you wanted to be retired, in which case you\\'d be given a pension.\" \"works for me,\" frank joked. \"it worked for a lot of people. bell got rich.\" \"so what you\\'re writing about,\" frank said, \"is the fact that these two guys, jan the pious and arthur the air-conditioned, shared a dream.\" \"exactly,\" stern said. \"them and a million others, down through the centuries. they all shared - they all share - the same bloody dream. you want more tea?\" \"sure,\" frank said. \"please.\"',\n",
       " 'stern filled his cup, and turned to annie. \"so,\" he said, with a let\\'s-get-down-to-business tone. \"what\\'s up?\" \"up?\" she asked. \"well,\" stern said, \"i know you didn\\'t call to say you love me - and, anyway, you said you were working on something. you said you and frank were working on something together.\" \"oh, yeah,\" annie replied, \"we are. we\\'re working on this... thing.\" then she turned to frank and, smiling, came as close to batting her eyes as a microbiologist can come. in this way, the ball was put firmly in his court. frank sighed, and cleared his throat. \"we\\'re interested in the temple of light,\" he said. for a moment the air seemed to go out of stern. his body tensed, ever so slightly, and then he leaned back in his armchair and held them with his gaze. he didn\\'t say anything for long time. finally, he turned to annie with a look that might have been reserved for someone who\\'d tried to sell him a fiftydollar rolex. \"what is this?\" he asked. annie blinked. frank frowned. \"what do you mean?\" she replied. \"\"what do i mean?\" jeez, annie! i haven\\'t seen you for what - two years - and then you call me up out of the blue and say, \"oh! by the way! this is my friend, and we\\'re interested in the temple of light?\" is this a joke?\" \"no,\" frank said, \"it\\'s not a joke.\" until now, stern had been looking at annie. abruptly, he turned to frank. \"who are you with?\" he asked in a matter-of-fact voice. \"who am i with?\" frank repeated. \"i\\'m not with anybody. i\\'m with annie.\" \"he writes for the post,\" annie said. \"really!\" stern cocked his head. \"what\\'s your phone number?\" \"my phone number?\" \"yeah! at work. what happens if i call you at the post?\" \"well, actually, i\\'m on a leave of absence.\" stern rolled his eyes. \"give me a break,\" he said. \"i\\'m serious! look.\" frank took out his wallet and showed him his press pass and his washington post id. \"anybody could make one of these,\" stern said. \"it\\'s a piece of shit.\" \"right! that\\'s how you know it\\'s authentic: the post\\'s cheap,\" frank said. \"this is ridiculous,\" annie declared. \"it\\'s me, ben! what are you thinking?\" stern ignored her, looking at frank. \"so if you\\'re on leave, what are you doing?\"',\n",
       " '\"i have a sam johnson fellowship.\" \"which is what?\" \"they have a sort of contest every year. reporters submit proposals, saying what they\\'d do if they had a year to write about what they\\'re interested in. so i gave them a proposal and... they liked it.\" stern held his gaze. \"and this was about the temple of light?\" \"no,\" frank said, \"it\\'s about emerging viruses.\" stern\\'s frown deepened. \"you can call the foundation. they\\'re in the book.\" \"and how do i know they aren\\'t a front?\" stern asked. \"the johnson foundation? for what?\" \"for the temple.\" \"the temple?!\" \"why not? the temple gives money to half a dozen foundations - the institute for religious experience, the gaia foundation. they spread it around. it\\'s good p.r.\" \"maybe. but they don\\'t give money to this foundation. trust me. old man coe would have a heart attack.\" stern continued looking at him, and then he nodded, as if he\\'d just made a decision. \"let me show you something,\" he said. getting to his feet, he crossed the room to a desk beside the window. pushing aside a pile of papers, he picked up a newsletter and returned with it to his chair. \"check it out,\" he said, and tossed the newsletter onto the steamer trunk between them. then he sat back down. it was the spring issue of armageddon watch -thirty-two pages of heavy stock paper, stapled down the middle. the cover blazed stories about the church of scientology and the internet, a santeria sect in western louisiana, and a brainwashing spa in the south of india. frank turned the pages one after another until he came to page eight. there, embedded in a column under the heading, \"personalities,\" was a picture of luc solange, squinting into the sun as he gripped the wheel of what must have been the crystal dragon. the cutline read, helmsman. frank showed it to annie. \"he\\'s handsome,\" she said, sounding a little surprised. beneath the picture was a short paragraph. a rare glimpse of temple of light guru, luc solange, at sea aboard the temple\\'s flagship, the crystal dragon. after 15 years in the u.s., the swiss-born solange is once again on the road, traveling most recently to tokyo, where he addressed the chosen soren organization this past november. (photo: anon.) \"nice job,\" frank said. \"i\\'ve got 341 subscribers,\" stern told him. \"mostly academics and parents. a couple of journalists, a',\n",
       " 'few p.i.\\'s - and, of course, the cults themselves. they\\'re the ones with p.o. boxes for addresses.\" \"have you written a lot about the temple?\" frank asked. stern shook his head. \"this is the first piece in more than a year. i\\'m sort of testing the waters.\" \"what do you mean?\" annie asked. \"i mean it\\'s dangerous,\" stern replied. \"it\\'s a hassle. i don\\'t need it.\" he paused for a moment, then went on. \"remember the last time we got together?\" annie nodded. \"i was submitting my grant proposal. two years ago.\" stern nodded. \"how\\'d that go, anyway?\" annie glanced at frank. \"they turned it down.\" stern winced in sympathy. \"bummer. anyway, that was the last time i wrote anything about the temple -until this.\" \"what did you write about the first time?\" frank asked. \"some of the same stuff that i\\'ve been telling you about. i drew connections between solange and earlier cult leaders, pointing out the similarities. i called him \"a secular apocalyptic\" who\\'s substituted the principles of deep ecology for the ten commandments. and he\\'s proactive, too. he wants to bring it on.\" \"what?\" \"the apocalypse. armageddon. whatever you want to call it. if you read what he\\'s written, solange says that he\\'s the last \"world historical\" figure -\" \"what do you mean?\" \"jesus, buddha -\" \"solange,\" annie suggested. \"exactly. and his importance lies in precisely that fact: he\\'s the midwife to the end-times. or so he says.\" \"but why would anyone want to be that?\" annie asked. stern\\'s eyebrows bounced up and down. \"solange doesn\\'t see things the way you and i do. his worldview is an ecocentric one.\" \"earth first,\" frank said. \"exactly. people aren\\'t the most important actors. nature is. what solange is after is the restoration of eden - which, among other things, means the end of industrial civilization.\" \"sounds like a dangerous man,\" frank remarked. \"you bet. that\\'s why they call him \"the first horseman.\"\"',\n",
       " '\"the first horseman?\" annie repeated. stern nodded. \"yeah. of the apocalypse.\" the three of them fell silent for a while, and sipped their tea. then frank said, \"so what happened to you? i mean, between you and them? you said you were \"testing the waters\\' when you published his picture.\" \"well, yeah,\" stern said. \"the piece i wrote back then was pretty straightforward, actually. mainly, it was a pull-together of things that other people had written -journalists, mostly - and a little historical perspective along the lines i just gave you. the only new material, really, came from a couple of reports i got from a friend in the a.g.\\'s office in california: his son disappeared into the children of god about ten years ago, and he\\'s been an activist against new religions ever since. anyway... they came after me.\" \"who came after you?\" annie asked. \"the temple. or, as they like to call themselves sometimes, \"the meek.\" they put me under surveillance.\" \"you\\'re kidding.\" \"no,\" stern said. \"it was just like the movies. i had a tail. there was a car outside my apartment sixteen hours a day, from six in the morning to ten at night, seven days a week.\" \"sounds expensive,\" frank remarked. \"i was flattered. i joked about it with them when i passed the car. then they killed my dog.\" \"what?\" \"oh, nooo,\" annie said. \"not the lab. not brownie!?\" \"someone gave him a steak, marinated in warfarin. you know what he was like! he\\'d eat anything, as long as it wasn\\'t dog food. poor guy... and then the phone started ringing all night long, no matter how often i changed the number, or had it unlisted - so i pulled the plug. the next thing you know, people are showing up at my office, screaming at me. i mean, these were not people you could talk to.\" \"what did they look like?\" frank asked, \"they looked like students. they looked normal. the only thing abnormal about them was that they were yelling at me - and throwing blood all around.\" annie blanched. \"once, a woman burst into the library, dragging a little kid behind her, screaming that she\\'d \"caught me\" with him! right after that, a couple of people in the department, including one of my thesis advisers, started getting e-mail.\" \"what kind of e-mail?\" frank asked. \"oh, it was this really jejune stuff. hate mail. i mean, one of the people in the department\\'s gay - it\\'s no secret - so naturally he receives this homophobic diatribe. and my thesis adviser\\'s african american, so guess what he gets? all this christian identity crap!\"',\n",
       " '\"and your name was on it?\" \"no, they\\'re much more subtle than that. they signed it the \"white avenger,\" or something. but that didn\\'t matter, because they routed it through my computer, and the police were able to trace it.\" \"how\\'d they route it through your computer?\" frank asked. \"easy,\" stern replied. \"they broke into the apartment when i was out, logged on, sent the e-mail, and that was that.\" \"that\\'s horrible,\" annie said. \"i was arrested,\" stern went on. \"they were going to charge me! with a hate crime! can you imagine?\" \"but you beat it,\" frank said. stern nodded, then laughed. \"yeah, they fucked up. i was teaching a seminar when the e-mail went out. it was right there in the header: thursday, two-fifteen pee-emm. i couldn\\'t have sent it.\" \"so what happened?\" \"nothing. the cops got in touch with the temple\\'s lawyers, and you know what they said? they said i was so crazy, i\\'d probably poisoned my own dog. and then they said, \"maybe he changed the clock on his computer\" - which, in fact, would be easy. i could have done that, but - duh! why bother, when you could send the letters through an anonymous remailer, and there wouldn\\'t even be any headers?\" \"so... was that the end of it?\" frank asked. stern shook his head. \"no. it went on for months. they filled out a change-of-address form at the post office - so my mail disappeared, which was a problem, because somebody started charging things on my visa and mastercards.\" \"what things?\" annie asked. \"embarrassing stuff, the kind of stuff that could get you in trouble - just for being on the mailing list. violent pornography. grow lights. precursor chemicals for meth. there were a thousand dollars in calls to 900 numbers, and subscriptions to newsletters from the north american man-boy love association and the church of the mountain.\" \"what\\'s the church of the mountain?\" annie asked. \"it\\'s a nazi thing. but the point is, i had a lot of collection agencies on my back - not to mention the dea and customs.\" annie rolled her eyes. \"then they filed a libel suit -\" \"what for?\" frank asked. \"why not? they could afford it. and it cost me an arm and a leg just to get it thrown out of court.\" \"and then?\"',\n",
       " '\"then nothing. they stopped.\" \"\"they stopped\"?\" annie repeated. \"yeah. they just... stopped. like they\\'d made their point, and now they were moving on to more important things. i guess it was a warning.\" \"jesus,\" frank whispered. \"so that\\'s why i\\'m a little paranoid,\" stern added. \"i mean, i put solange back in the newsletter - and, the next thing i know, you show up, asking about the temple. you can see where i\\'m coming from.\" frank nodded. \"yeah,\" he said, \"i can.\" \"i\\'ll make some more tea,\" annie said, getting to her feet. wordlessly, she took the teapot from the top of the trunk and carried it into the kitchen. stern looked at frank. \"you know,\" he said, \"the one thing they never did: they never tried to kill me.\" \"yeah, well... the night\\'s young.\" \"but they would have, you know. i mean, if i\\'d been anything more than a nuisance.\" \"you think so?\" \"i know so. and i mention it because - i don\\'t know what you and annie are doing-\" frank started to say something, but stern cut him off. \"- and i don\\'t want to know. i just think you ought to be careful. for her sake.\" \"i will be,\" frank said. \"i\\'m kind of fond of her myself.\" he paused for a second, then went on. \"but the thing that can help us the most is information.\" stern shrugged. \"what can i tell you? how much do you know?\" \"solange is swiss.\" stern nodded. \"he came to the states in \"eighty-two. they say he was broke.\" \"why\\'d he leave?\" \"i think he wanted a bigger canvas. i think switzerland was getting a little claustrophobic. he\\'d run for parliament on the green ticket, and split the party by insisting on a lot of ultra positions - which got a bunch of people mad at him. and then, about the same time, his business went under.\" \"what business was that?\" \"he had a homeopathy clinic in montreux, and a couple of patients died of kidney failure - some kind of herbal remedy that backfired.\" \"so he came to the states.\" \"yeah, he came to the states. and he opened a clinic in l.a. did pretty well. got involved in environmental politics. started something called \"verdure,\" which was a little like earth first! but a lot',\n",
       " 'more secretive. got some press, got some followers. started to give lectures in the u.s. and abroad.\" \"then what?\" stern\\'s cigarette had been out for a while, so he lit another, and blew a long stream of smoke into the air above frank\\'s head. \"well, he got bigger. and bigger. i think it was around \"ninety-two... a guy who\\'d been in the moonies took over \"the recruitment hat.\" \"what do you mean - \"hat\"?\" \"they have a \"hat\" for everything: finance, recruitment, intelligence.\" \"intelligence?\" stern nodded. \"yeah. they\\'ve got an in-house intel bureau that\\'s as good as it gets. anyway, this guy from the moonies - i mean he used to be in the moonies -he comes in, sits down, and reorganizes their recruitment operations. so, now, all of a sudden, they\\'re really aggressive. and diabolical. they go after two groups: people in their twenties, because they\\'ve got energy; and people in their eighties, because they\\'ve got pensions. they set up nonprofits \"to help\" unwed mothers, \"counsel\" kids with drug problems, and \"care\" for the elderly. but what they\\'re really doing, of course, is getting close to a lot of vulnerable people -who turn out to be the easiest people to recruit. they even started lonely hearts clubs in half a dozen cities, just so they could arrange dates between members and people they wanted to recruit.\" \"i see why you called it \"diabolical,\"\" frank said. \"it was amazing. they paid ten thousand dollars for a database composed entirely of deadbeats. i mean, people who were drowning in debt. they ran their credit histories, and built up dossiers on every one of them. then they banged on their doors and promised to show them a way out. \"you\\'re a victim,\" they said. \"you\\'re not to blame. it\\'s america that\\'s at fault! amerika with a k. it\\'s consumerism! pack a bag, burn your bills, and come with us. we\\'ll give you a job, instant friends, and a place to stay.\" and that\\'s what they did. only they forgot to mention that the jobs didn\\'t actually pay anything, and the place to stay was a dorm where people were sleeping four to a room. not that it mattered. by then they\\'d been love-bombed by every babe or baldwin in the org, and sleeping four hours a night, every other night!\" stern paused and caught his breath. \"it was a helluva recruitment operation,\" he said. \"so, what happened?\" frank asked. stern shrugged. \"they reached critical mass. one day there\\'s this deep ecology thing called \"verdure,\" with maybe two hundred members. two years later there are thousands of people, their eyes are glazed, and they\\'re calling themselves the \"temple of light.\"\" \"where\\'s the sugar?\" annie called out from the kitchen. \"i\\'m all out,\" stern said. \"so how many people are in the temple?\" frank asked. \"according to them?\" stern replied. \"thirty thousand. but actually? maybe a quarter of that. but even that number - there\\'s an inner and outer order.\"',\n",

       " 'stern shook his head. \"look, what i\\'m telling you is this: if you piss them, they\\'ll come after you one day you\\'ll wake up and - boom! you\\'ll be gone.\" \"that\\'s the part i hate,\" frank said, stirring his tea. \"i always hate it when i disappear.\" \"it isn\\'t funny,\" stern said. frank nodded. \"i\\'m not laughing. but getting back to what you were saying, about the money... they get most of their money from what? vitamins? patents?\" stern shook his head. \"no.\" \"plus the gifts,\" frank said. \"from the members. and i suppose they tithe -\" \"that\\'s not the point,\" stern said. \"that\\'s not where the big bucks are from. the big bucks come from somewhere else.\" frank looked puzzled. \"where?\" he asked. stern stubbed out his cigarette and immediately lit another. \"chosen soren,\" he said. frank thought about it, and then remembered. \"oh, you mean the japanese guys,\" he said. \"in your newsletter.\" \"right,\" stern replied. \"except, chosen soren isn\\'t japanese, really. it\\'s for koreans who work in japan. mostly north koreans. they do the shit work for the japanese, and they send a lot of their money home. it\\'s a big foreign-exchange earner.\" \"and that\\'s where the temple gets its money?\" stern nodded. \"most of it.\" frank was dumbfounded. \"but... why?\" \"i don\\'t know,\" stern replied, \"but the koreans have given them fifty million bucks since \"ninety-five.\" \"how do you know that?\" \"customs report. i got it from the a.g.\\'s office in california. they busted this guy who was riding circuit - l.a., tokyo, geneva - back to l.a. and like that. i guess they found a lot of cash on him that he wasn\\'t supposed to have. anyway, they questioned the guy, and he cracked. he told them everything he was doing.\" \"which was what?\" \"moving money, lots of money, in and out of different accounts, so no one could tell where it came from.\" \"and this was that... chosen soren money?\" \"yeah.\" \"so where is this guy?\" stern blew a smoke ring at the ceiling. \"they fucked up. instead of pursuing the case, customs had him',\n",
       " 'deported. next thing you know, he gets off the plane at narita, and that\\'s it. he never gets out of the customs hall. his wife is standing there with two kids, right outside passport control and - forget about it. all they found were his suitcases, sitting on a cart in the hall. end of story.\" \"they never found him?\" \"no. it\\'s like i said: end of story.\" \"hey!\" the shout was annie\\'s. she was standing at the window with her teacup in her hand, crouching slightly to yell at someone outside. \"hey!\" \"what\\'s the matter?\" frank said, moving quickly to her side. \"someone\\'s in your car.\" he pushed the curtain aside and, looking out, saw that she was right. the saab was at the curb in front of the apartment house, and the driver\\'s door was wide open. a woman in a blue dress was leaning inside, half in and half out of the car. \"be right back,\" frank said, and without waiting for annie, went through the front door, past the elevator, and down the stairs, two at a time. a few seconds later he was in the lobby, and then he was in the street. his car door was closed and the woman was about twenty yards away, pushing a stroller toward the corner. \"wait a second!\" he called, and loped after her. \"hey! excuse me?\" the woman turned, raising a hand to shade the sunlight from her eyes, and he saw that she was young just a girl, really - with the freckled innocence of a 4-h beauty queen. \"hi\" she said, bathing him in a bright and glittering smile. he found himself unexpectedly out of breath, more from the excitement than the exercise, so his voice was choppy. \"sorry i yelled, but - i was looking out the window and - you were - you know - you were in my car. the smile exploded. \"was that your car?\" she asked, rolling the stroller back and forth to keep the baby happy. \"yeah,\" frank said, feeling a little foolish in the searchlight of her friendliness. \"it was.\" \"oh! well, i turned out the lights for you. you left them on:\" \"i did?\" he thought about it for a second. \"i don\\'t think so. why would i have the lights on? it\\'s -\" she shook her head, and he saw that she had green eyes. \"i don\\'t know. were you, like, in a tunnel or something?\" the baby gurgled, and frank glanced in its direction. he couldn\\'t tell if it was a boy or a girl, but like its mother, it was adorable. \"cute kid,\" he said. \"thanks!\" she replied, cocking her head like a cheerleader at the end of a routine. then she turned and gave the stroller a little push. \"i have to go now,\" she said. \"papa\\'s coming home.\" \"well... thanks for the help,\" frank said.',\n",
       " 'as he walked back to stern\\'s apartment, he saw that the car lights were off - which was good (though, of course, the battery might still be dead). he\\'d try it in a minute, but first he had to get annie. \"who was it?\" she asked. \"i don\\'t know. i guess i left the lights on. she turned them off.\" \"you did?\\'\" \"yeah,\" he said. \"i didn\\'t notice any lights.\" frank shrugged. \"well, it\\'s good she did. anyway...\" turning to stern, he offered his hand. \"we better get going,\" he said. \"but... thanks for the help - really.\" \"no problem.\" \"if i have to, can i get back to you?\" \"well \"stern said, thinking about it. \"i guess... but... if you and the temple are going at it - don\\'t call me from your house. and for chrissake, don\\'t just drop by. send smoke signals or something.\" frank laughed. as they went out to the car, annie was shaking her head. \"i\\'m sure you didn\\'t leave your lights on,\" she said. \"right. i didn\\'t leave my lights on. so what? did you hear what he was saying? about this chosen thing? fifty million dollars? what\\'s that all about?\" \"i don\\'t know,\" annie said. \"i\\'m more worried about this vitamin factory, or whatever it is.\" he opened the door to the saab and slid behind the wheel. annie was saying something about microencapsulation as he put the key in the ignition and switched it on. the saab started with a roar, but the sound was almost drowned out by frank\\'s exclamation: \"what the fuck is that!?\" annie turned to him and saw that he was looking at his hands - which, like the steering wheel, were wet with a kind of transparent grease. \"what\\'s the matter?\" annie asked. he was holding his hands in front of him, palms up, like a catholic saint. \"i don\\'t know,\" he said. \"it\\'s like i\\'ve been slimed. get me a towel from the back, okay?\" annie reached into the backseat, where a roll of paper towels rested on the floor. grabbing a handful, she helped him get the grease off his fingers and the steering wheel. when they were done, frank stuffed the towels under the front seat, shifted into gear and pulled out of the parking space, heading toward annie\\'s house in mount pleasant. \"she did that,\" annie said.',\n",
       " '\"did what?\" \"put that stuff on the steering wheel, what do you think?\" \"i don\\'t know what i think. i think it was gross.\" annie shivered. \"it\\'s not right,\" she said. \"she had a baby. it\\'s probably just some kinda baby stuff,\" frank said. \"something that was on her hands.\" they went up foxhall road to nebraska, and cut across to wisconsin. they sat for a couple of minutes in front of the sidwell friends school, which was just letting out, then turned left onto porter and cut across the park to mount pleasant. the trip took about twenty minutes, and by the time they got to her house, he didn\\'t feel well. \"you okay?\" she asked. he nodded. \"yeah, i\\'m all right. i\\'m a little out of it, is all. i haven\\'t eaten anything all day.\" annie gave him a skeptical look as she eased out of the car. then she turned and leaned in through the window. \"you\\'re certain?\" she asked. \"yeah. too much tea, or something.\" and then he was off, nosing through the traffic on his way to columbia road, driving past the bodegas and nightclubs and cop cars . . there was so much to pay attention to - like the drunks on the corner, and the dogs, and the 7-eleven. when he reached columbia road, he realized with surprise that he was sweating, a sour, clammy sweat, like the onset of a fever. and, really, he didn\\'t feel well at all. his heart was racing, and he had this shaky feeling in his stomach and chest - like stage fright, except he wasn\\'t onstage. he was in his car, and the adrenaline was surging through him for no reason at all. it wasn\\'t like he was going fast. in fact, he was going - what? six miles an hour. no wonder they were all beeping at him. something was wrong, and he knew what it was: suddenly, he was intensely aware of every possibility, and saw in every possibility a threat. if for example, he turned the wheel a bit to the left, the car would cross the centerline, and crash. that there was no reason for him to turn the wheel was irrelevant. the point was: he could. and that possibility was a terrifying one because, of course, a lot of people would be hurt. and if before turning the wheel, he sped up, the car might then continue onto the sidewalk, plowing into god knows how many people. so that there\\'d be blood everywhere. the fear he felt was a kind of vertigo, irrational and uncontrollable. anyone could walk a straight line, but try to do that on the railing of a balcony, a hundred feet above the street, and you\\'d go over. and that was how he felt now, as if he were about \"to go over,\" as if his mind were pulling him over an invisible ledge. driving was impossibly complicated -like rubbing your stomach while patting your head. so much could go wrong so easily, and catastrophically. how could anyone do it? how could they pay attention to so many things at the same time? to the speedometer and gearshift, the clutch,',\n",
       " 'brakes, and accelerator - other cars, and traffic lights, people crossing and recrossing the street. the tachometer! the world was a tidal wave of places and events, foaming with consequences. and i\\'m drowning in it, frank thought. and the other problem was: a crucial part of him was missing - his stance toward the world, or his perspective on it. it was as if he\\'d forgotten not so much who he was, but what it was like to be who he was. not the facts of himself, but his interpretation of himself. suddenly, he knew what it was: he\\'d forgotten his point of view. he\\'d forgotten what it was like to be frank daly, and having forgotten that, he couldn\\'t imagine ever getting it back. his whole vocabulary of being had vanished, so that to be himself was like trying to speak a language he\\'d never learned. it was beyond his grasp. he was beyond his grasp. and this realization filled him with a feeling of dread that was all the more profound for the fact that it was inescapable - it came from within, from the place where frank was supposed to be, and where now there was nothing. a hole. he knew what had happened, of course. he\\'d been drugged. by stern, or by annie, or else by the girl that he\\'d caught in his car. the freckled mommy with the bright smile. but knowing this was no consolation at all. whoever had done it had taken everything from him, so that now there was less than nothing left. there was no him left. and he knew that he\\'d never get better because what he\\'d lost was about as substantial - and elusive - as eastern standard time. it was taking an awfully long time to get back to his apartment - which was where he needed to be. so he floored it. the saab lurched into the opposite lane and shot forward down the busy street, parting the traffic like a zipper. a man in a business suit dove toward the curb, and horns exploded from every direction. chief ike\\'s mambo room flashed past, followed in rapid succession by popeye\\'s, mixtec, the crestar bank, and a knot of bodhisattvas, waiting for the light to change at the corner of eighteenth and columbia road. he had to get to bed. he\\'d be safe in bed. but first he had to park the car. and, under the circumstances, there was no way he could do that. even if he found a spot, parking the saab would be like docking the space shuttle, maneuvering a ton of steel through three dimensions, using only his hands and feet. impossible. no one could do it. so he slammed on the brakes with both of his feet, bringing the car to a shivering halt in the middle of the street. as he got out, he turned on the lights, thinking it would make it easier to find the car later. he was surprised at how woozy he felt. it was almost as if his head were on roller bearings. a man came toward him from the sidewalk, speaking quietly in spanish, then backed away, frightened by something in frank\\'s eyes. a moment later (or maybe it was longer - maybe it was an hour later), he was standing in his apartment, listening to his telephone messages. \"frank! it\\'s jennifer. about these satellite expenses... 7s this a joke? give us a call.\" and the next message: \"hey, frankie! it\\'s your uncle sid. listen, everybody\\'s broke up about your dad, but - hey, it was good to see ya and... y\\'know, don\\'t be such a stranger!\" and the third message, from a woman who wanted to wish him well: \"hi there! we met this afternoon?',\n",
       " 'i just wanted to say, have a nice trip - and, oh yeah! if you want to come back? and stay back? maybe you should work on something else!\" and then the phone was ringing, and the answering machine switched on, and it was annie: \"frank it\\'s me. i\\'m worried about that stuff that was on the steering wheel. call me back, okay? or maybe... maybe i\\'ll just come over... are you there? pick up!\" not likely. the phone was pulsing, rising and falling like a termite queen, breathing in the dark. and his hands - jesus, his hands! you could do such terrible things with your hands....',\n",
       " \"chapter 25 the compound may 23 the temple's headquarters were on the campus of what was formerly a private school. about twenty miles from lake placid, the old school grounds lay behind an impressive set of rusted iron gates in a long and serpentine valley. once past the gates, an asphalt drive twisted through a forest of tigertail spruce, arriving eventually at a small clearing that served as a parking lot. from there a gravel path led through a dark wood, emerging in a tamed meadow, where a black-water pond sat at the foot of a low and gently sloping hill. at the western edge of the meadow were a cluster of white cottages that had formerly housed the school's teachers but were now reserved for the temple's senior staff. nearby, a pair of crumbling dormitories were home to the rank and file of the temple's inner order. more impressive were the labs. these were an interconnected complex of hypermodern glass and steel structures that housed the compound's infirmary, food hall, administration offices, research laboratories, and production facilities. it was from here that the temple ran its international operations, while manufacturing a mix of vitamins, homeopathic remedies, and aromatherapy products. at the top of the hill, in full surveillance of the dormitories and the labs, was the headmaster's house, an immaculately restored tudor mansion with mullioned windows, surrounded by vine-clad pergolas. this, then, was solange's residence, and the temple's inner sanctum. sitting on the flagstone terrace under a canopy of pink wisteria, susannah gazed at the surrounding mountains and wished her nervousness would go away. the problem was, she didn't know why she was here. and this made her nervous, because there were stories about the terrace and things that happened there. but that's all they were, she told herself, stories. the truth was, being summoned to the temple's headquarters was almost always a good thing. solange sometimes arranged marriages among the staff and when he did, the announcements were always made on the terrace. so, also, it was on the terrace that rewards were handed out, and special tasks assigned. which, susannah thought, was the reason she was there - for something good. and, after all, what else could it be? she'd done everything she'd been asked to do - in rhinebeck, l.a., and washington - and everything had gone off without a hitch. on the other hand, so had tommy and vaughn and everyone else. so why was she the only one who'd been asked to come to the compound? why was she the only one on the operations team sitting on the terrace?\",\n",
       " 'shyly, because little stephen was feeding at her breast, she looked up at solange, who was questioning belinda about a defector. \"so how did you find him?\" \"the p.i.s found him. he was in a motel somewhere, and i guess he made a mistake.\" \"and what was that?\" \"he phoned home. they always phone home. just like e.t.\" solange nodded, happy with the reply. \"and kramer had the phones covered?\" belinda nodded. \"there\\'s a phone-phreak he works with. i think he put something on the line, or maybe he hacked the caller id. anyway, they found him in a motel 6 on the jersey shore.\" \"and where is he now?\" solange asked, referring to the defector. belinda tossed her head in the direction of the labs. \"infirmary. doc\\'s got him stoned to the gills on halcion and thorazine - so it\\'s not like he\\'s talking to anybody. if you want to talk to him, they\\'ll have to bring him down.\" solange shook his head. \"no, just keep him that way.\" he\\'s so cool, susannah thought. he stands there with his head tilted back and his eyes half closed, like a jazz musician listening to someone else\\'s solo. and then, when he moves, it\\'s on the balls of his feet, like a quarterback dropping back into the pocket. he\\'s like a cat, susannah thought. but not a tabby. solange was just over six feet tall, and lean as a snake. he wore faded jeans and hiking boots, and a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows. a dark stubble peppered his cheeks, and his inkblack hair needed cutting. agate eyes under thick brows, flecked with gray. the eyes have it, susannah thought, making a joke (but not really). that\\'s where his power comes from -it\\'s not what he says, but the way he looks at you when he says it, as if to say, you\\'re the only one who understands, the only one who really understands. and when you heard that, or saw it, or sensed it, well, it was almost like falling in love. which wouldn\\'t be hard. solange was the most attractive man susannah had ever seen - not that he was handsome, really. not in the ordinary sense of the word. he was saved from being \"handsome\" by his nose, which had long ago been broken, and never reset. the result was an eagle\\'s beak that, with his eyes, gave his face a predatory cast, even when he was laughing. and there was the voice. as deep as a mine, it was lightly accented and cadenced in a way that was strangely compelling. watching him talk, listening to him speak, feeling him with her eyes, susannah knew that she was in the presence of a great man. or a swarm of great men. at one time or another, the newspapers had compared him to hitler and the pied piper, john muir and koot houmi (whoever that was - she meant to look it up). and the others shared her feelings. like her, they were enraptured by solange (and just a little afraid of him).',\n",
       " 'there were fifteen of them on the terrace, in addition to little stephen, susannah, and their guru. each of them was \"on staff which meant that they lived their lives entirely within the orbit of the organization. at one time or another, all of them had sailed on the crystal dragon, and since then, they\\'d shared meals and beds, safe houses and codes, secrets and felonies. they were full-time communards, and they were everything to one another - family, lovers, shipmates, friends. they had no one but themselves, and no possessions but those that they held in common. even their pasts were not their own, for each of them shared the same symbolic birthday - which was the date they\\'d come \"on staff.\" while her baby sucked at her breast, susannah\\'s eyes drifted from one person to another. with the exception of herself and one other person, she saw, each of them was a divisional director, or a deputy. within the temple, these people were legends, and susannah knew almost all of them. the emaciated man with tobacco-stained fingers was saul, who ran the division in which she herself worked, the office of special affairs. sitting on either side of him were his deputies - antonio, belinda, and jane who were in charge of research, operations, and security. veroushka, who was said to be solange\\'s mistress and who was so sexy that tommy said he could \"smell her across the room,\" was responsible for recruitment. in addition to veroushka and the special affairs crew, there were the directors and deputy directors of banking and communications, as well as the heads of administration, technical services, and litigation. susannah knew who they were, but not their names, or not all of them, anyway. and there was one person she didn\\'t know at all, a jap or something, who clearly didn\\'t belong. dressed in a dark suit, white shirt and tie, he stood apart from the others, silently observing. \"what about the parents?\" solange asked. belinda turned to a weedy young man who was sitting nearby with his back against the wall, looking bored. \"fred?\" \"they know he\\'s here,\" the lawyer said, \"but there\\'s nothing they can do about it. he doesn\\'t have to see them, he doesn\\'t have to talk to them. he\\'s twenty-three. besides, i\\'ve got an affidavit from him, saying everything\\'s fine - or i will, anyway, as soon as i can get it typed up.\" \"and you think he\\'ll sign that?\" \"he signed it five years ago, when he came on staff. everybody signed one. more than one! now, we just have to fill in the date and decide what it says.\\'\" \"okay!\" solange said, clapping his hands together and turning on his heel. \"who\\'s next? avram! what can you tell us?\" the chief of the temple\\'s technical services division was a wall-eyed russian refugee with a bad case of psoriasis. cleaning his bifocals with the hem of his shirt, he cleared his throat and glanced myopically in solange\\'s direction. then he smiled. \"we\\'re ready to go,\" he said. solange regarded him with surprise. \"you\\'re kidding.\" \"no. though, if you don\\'t mind, i must tell you: this was not an easy thing. we\\'ve worked around the clock for nearly eight months - on this and nothing else. we\\'ve had temperature problems. we\\'ve had problems of competence and discipline with one or two of the staff. and the vaccine!\" he paused and',\n",

       " 'susannah\\'s heart stopped for the second time in as many minutes. \"wh-what problem?\" she asked, looking up at solange. he shook his head regretfully. \"the little boy,\" he said. suddenly, susannah knew why she was there, knew what was wrong, knew what she\\'d done. when you joined the temple, you gave up having children because people were... what was the word solange used? meta-sizing! they were metasizing all over the world. like roaches. and this was the biggest problem, but... \"but -\" \"sshhhh!\" solange whispered, and pulled her to him even more tightly. she hadn\\'t realized how strong he was. \"no excuses. i told you, cher: you\\'re a hero! you\\'ll always be a hero - so don\\'t fuck it up with a lot of bullshit. okay?\" she nodded. removing his arm from around her shoulders, he walked over to a sort of wood box that susannah hadn\\'t noticed before. lifting its lid, he reached inside and withdrew a handful of transparent, plastic garbage bags. one by one he passed them out to the people sitting on the terrace. without thinking, susannah reached for a bag, but solange shook his head. \"not for you, cher. for them.\" crossing the flagstones to belinda, he lifted stephen by the arm, shook out one of the bags, and put the baby inside. then he spun the bag in his hand and knotted it off at the top. \"take it,\" he said, and gave it to belinda. susannah couldn\\'t believe it. she was speechless as stephen\\'s muffled cries seeped through the bag. she could see him in there, thrashing around, raising the temperature, turning the bag\\'s transparent skin opaque. her knees buckled, but solange caught her by the arm and steadied her. \"you have to be strong,\" he said. \"for the little boy -it\\'s important, cher.\" then he turned to the others. \"okay,\" solange said. \"everyone except susannah and mr. kim.\" one by one her friends put their heads into the plastic bags and tied them off at the throat. horrified, susannah watched the bags puff in and out, contracting around their cheeks and noses, then pushing out again. solange returned to the wood box and reached inside a second time, returning with two pairs of boxing gloves. tossing a pair to susannah, he gestured for her to put them on, and did the same himself. \"it\\'s a complicated problem,\" solange said as he worked his hands into the gloves. \"earth, she is the mother - sacred. just as life is. this is our religion. this is what we know. but we know, too, that we\\'re killing her - you and me - we\\'re killing her, and we\\'re killing her children — the millions of species she generates. (don\\'t worry about making a knot, cher. just get your hands in them.) we\\'ve punched holes in the atmosphere, poisoned the groundwater, fouled the soil, laid waste to the forests. now, with these bags, maybe you can understand how the earth feels, what it\\'s like to be smothered in plastic, choking on your own gases. now, when i tell you civilization is murder, maybe you will remember this.\" solange clapped his hands together and shuffled his feet. \"is it okay to let stephen out?\" susannah asked. \"i don\\'t think this is so good for him.\" \"but, cher, that\\'s just the point. i don\\'t think he\\'s so good for us, do you? hey - you know as well as i',\n",
       " 'do, what is the problem? it\\'s population, eh? we\\'re too many. and yet, you give us another predator to feed. what were you thinking about? what were you thinking with?\" susannah shook her head. solange was between her and stephen now, and she couldn\\'t see him. \"if it were anyone else, cher, i\\'d drown him like a baby cat. as an example. but he\\'s yours, so i tell you what we\\'ll do: we\\'ll box for him! one round. three minutes. and if you\\'re standing at the end of that, you can rescue him, cher, okay? but if you are not, well, then, i think he stays where he is.\" \"but - i can\\'t. i don\\'t know how!\" the panic was surging in her chest. \"i\\'ll teach you. the important thing is to get going, you know? because until then it\\'s just a waste of time, eh?\" susannah nodded. \"okay, so now we start. a little punch. c\\'mon, cher, it\\'s like you said. i don\\'t think this is so good for him.\" she jabbed at him, and solange stepped gracefully to the side, eyeing his wristwatch. \"okay, the liftoff. but maybe not so good. punch through me, cher not at me! c\\'mon!\" she knew how to fight. she\\'d grown up with three brothers, and one of them had been a bully. but she couldn\\'t concentrate on solange. it was taking all her strength not to rush over to belinda and stars] suddenly, she saw stars. solange snapped her head back with a left jab, then rocked her with a right cross that sent a stream of little lights across her eye. she staggered backward, disbelieving. her brother had never hit her like that. \"keep your hands up, cher, and close on me. i have too much reach for you. c\\'mon! you have to think. get inside my arms.\" she could taste the blood in her mouth, and her eyes stung with tears. what did he say? about standing? about being on her feet? about stephen? solange threw a left that she took on the shoulder, and then a right that she avoided, jumping back. \"good! two minutes now!\" he said he\\'d leave him where he was. he said he\\'d leave him in the bag. \"not bad,\" solange said, \"but you have to get inside, cher, or you\\'ll get hurt. i\\'m too big for you.\" she was moving in a circle around him, trying to stay away from his arms but not really succeeding. he kept closing her off, hitting her with a succession of jabs, pounding her upper arms. \"don\\'t ever run when you\\'re attacked, cher. it\\'s an important lesson. when someone comes after you, go after him. otherwise...\" he set her up in mid-sentence, popping her with three quick jabs that loosened her teeth and filled her mouth with blood. then he pivoted at the hips, stepped in and hit her so hard in the stomach that it felt like the butt end of a telephone pole had been driven through her. suddenly, she was on her hands and knees, unable to breathe, choking on the pain she felt. \"a minute twenty!\" solange said, standing over her. \"c\\'mon, susannah! get up, or i\\'ll add injury time!\"',\n",
       " 'she still couldn\\'t breathe, but she did what he told her to do: she pushed herself up from the flagstones and, ducking her head, rushed into his arms, tying him up. the move surprised him, and she took advantage of the surprise to hit him twice, catching his jaw the second time. she held him as tightly as she could, locking her arms around his back. together, they turned in a circle, and she saw the faces of her friends, pulsing inside the bags, watching her. but something was missing, and as she struggled to hold on to the much stronger solange, she realized what it was, and it panicked her: little stephen wasn\\'t crying anymore. \"thirty seconds, cher! don\\'t let me down!\" she clung to him as hard as she could, but he twisted suddenly, rolling away from her. and then he began to headhunt, popping her in the mouth, the nose, the chin, the cheeks, one jab after another, turning her in a circle around the terrace, showering her eyes with stars, heating her face with punches. she was barely standing, shocked and swaying on trembling knees. slowly, she raised a glove to her face and touched her cheek, as if to make sure that her face was still there. and, dazedly, she saw him windmilling his right arm like he was a fast-pitch softball player, or a cartoon boxer getting ready to deliver a punch that would send her into outer space. then he laughed and stepped forward, and like a groom at a wedding, he pulled her into his arms and lifted her off the ground. \"not bad, cher, not bad at all.\" then he turned to the others and with a wicked grin shouted, \"what are you doing with bags on your heads? are you so ugly? take them off! what silly people!\" and so the bags came off, and everyone was laughing and gasping at the same time, while mr. kim applauded and susannah fell to her knees at little stephen\\'s side and, frantic and bleeding, tore at the bag with her fingers. a moment later the boy was in her arms, crying with life, and she was so happy, she burst into tears and, with an adoring look at solange, thought thank you thank you thank you...',\n",
       " 'chapter 26 \"i\\'ll be back at five,\" annie said. \"you call me if you start feeling funny - you promise?\" frank sat in the easy chair in annie\\'s living room, in front of the television set, which was tuned to the today show. at first it seemed to him that katie couric was speaking with annie\\'s voice, although he knew that wasn\\'t true. \"frank?\" he frowned and leaned toward the television. katie spoke but it seemed to take a long time for her words to reach his brain. he felt as if he were watching a foreign movie, with subpar lip-synching. \"are you all right?\" he turned to annie. her words seemed also to arrive in his brain after a small but significant delay, as if she were on the phone from tokyo. \"tip-top,\" he said, swiveling back toward the television. katie couric said something that sounded like \"poppadom crocodile.\"',\n",

       " '- were stitched, splinted, and bandaged. as long as he was in one of his \"lucid\" periods, he thought, he ought to work. he headed, slowly, up the stairs to annie\\'s room. typing or even operating a mouse with his hand like this was slow going, but at least he could do it. his laptop, which annie had brought over from his apartment, was impossible. yesterday, he\\'d printed out his interview with tom deer, and he scanned it as he waited for annie\\'s computer to boot up. deer: you couldn\\'t threaten anyone with it. all you could do is use it. and then the birds would take it. you start a herald wave in some place like peking, and bam! it\\'s all over the map. frank drummed his fingers on the table. deer: everyone gets the flu. that\\'s the thing about it. you can\\'t control it. so if you used it as a weapon... you\\'d kill millions. deer: why would anyone want to do that? deer: you couldn\\'t stop it. frank remembered deer joking around at the end of their interview, kidding about the sioux. what did he say? he frowned, looked through the pages. deer: on the other hand, if someone wanted revenge... if they were mad at the world... mad at the world. the more he learned about the temple of light or at least its leader - the more apparent it became that the group was definitely \"mad at the world.\" and frank knew that killing \"tens of millions of people\" would be grand as far as solange was concerned. in fact, it would go a long way toward redressing what the temple\\'s leader called an \"infestation of a species gone amuck.\" that species, of course, being humankind. annie\\'s computer played the corny little windows fanfare and frank logged into editor, a directory he\\'d created to hold the word processor he liked to use: xywrite. yesterday he\\'d spent a couple of hours on the net, exploring sites related to the temple of light. and he\\'d summarized what he found in a file called overview. temple-solange le monde: temple of light founded lausanne in early seventies. original name: academie des recherches et de la connaissance des hautes sciences - arch. 1979: two of its members firebombed the cathedral at einsiedeln, protesting the pope\\'s opposition to birth control. 1980: member indicted for murder in drive-by shooting of the director of the swiss nuclear authority. other incidents included violent attacks on environmental organizations that solange said were \"insufficiently militant.\" following suspicious death of a liberal politician who\\'d pronounced solange \"a bacillus of hatred within the green movement,\" arch and its leader disappeared from public view. two years later the organization reemerged in san francisco as the temple of light, a newly incorporated \"religion\" guided by luc solange. according to u.s. news & world report: solange \"served up a weird mix of mysticism and \"deep ecology\" to a following that was remarkably well-educated.\" temple recruiters were \"particularly active on the science and engineering campuses of some of america\\'s best universities.\" under the heading \"temple money,\" he detailed how the temple\\'s recruitment of scientists had paid',\n",
       " 'off, both through its line of eco-vita products and through the substantial royalties derived from temple patents. he noted that the temple\\'s most lucrative patents, worth about $10 million a year, were micro-encapsulation techniques leased to pharmaceutical concerns. he quoted annie: adair (5-12-98): \"basically, microencapsulation encloses very small particles in self-decaying protective sheaths, enabling biological agents to survive in conditions - such as stomach acid or high temperatures - that would otherwise kill them.\" he yawned, and frowned. his concentration was for shit; it faded in and out like a weak cellular telephone signal. stern, he thought. he ought to get in touch with stern. and, in fact, he\\'d tried. he\\'d called him three times, but so far stern had not returned the calls. he ought to check him. after all, it had been outside the grad student\\'s apartment that he\\'d been drugged, so the girl who did it must have known who he was talking to. but he didn\\'t want to drive over there now. he was too tired, and he was finding it impossible to concentrate. he\\'d check on stern tomorrow, or the day after, and make sure he was okay. the police had been finished with the car for three or four days now, and yesterday he\\'d been called and told to retrieve it from the impoundment lot. starting monday, the clerk told him, he\\'d be charged twenty bucks a day for storage. there was also the towing fee. he couldn\\'t believe it. it was like being raped a second time. on thursday his eye was almost normal-looking, and the stitches in his lip were out. no longer a danger to himself or others, he\\'d bailed the saab out. when annie went to atlanta for an annual gathering of influenza specialists, which she called \"the flu powwow,\" it seemed awkward - staying in her apartment without her - so he moved back to his own place. indu had never really warmed up to him. in annie\\'s opinion, this was probably because the second night frank had stayed at the apartment, just back from the hospital, he\\'d wandered into indu\\'s room by mistake and climbed into bed with her. how he ended up in annie\\'s bed, how they had become lovers - this event was lost somewhere in the fog bank of his memory, where it might well remain forever. sometimes he caught a glimpse of it, a shudder of memory. once or twice he had a flash of her concerned face, leaning over him, and when he spoke her name, \"annie,\" her face lighting up in a sudden flare of joy. and then he could see her bending over, tenderly pressing a damp towel to his forehead, and remember her sliding into bed next to him, her warm body stretched out along the length of him. and then the memory would turn gauzy and dissolve. twice she\\'d referred to their \"first time,\" once with a happy, starry look in her eyes, the second time with a lascivious giggle. he just smiled, because it clearly wouldn\\'t do to ask. besides, it was kind of fun - if distracting - to imagine... in bed, annie was surprisingly uninhibited and passionate, or at least as passionate as his injuries allowed. stern still hadn\\'t returned his messages, so on his way back from the impoundment lot, frank drove to the grad student\\'s apartment. and though he wasn\\'t to be found at home, neither was there any evidence that he was missing. no piles of newspapers or mail. he knocked on a neighbor\\'s door. a skinny black man wearing wire-rimmed glasses answered. no, he said, he hadn\\'t seen stern. \"must be outta town, because i don\\'t hear any music. he likes his music, i can tell you. likes it too much, in my opinion.\"',\n",
       " 'frank pressed him. \"does he ever, i don\\'t know, ask you to water his plants, take in his mail or anything?\" stern\\'s neighbor stared at him. \"ben doesn\\'t have any plants. he\\'s not the plant type. i told you: he\\'s the music type. i don\\'t know about the mail. i think he has a post office box somewhere.\" he peered at frank. \"how well are you knowing ben?\" \"not well at all,\" frank conceded. the slender man made a spiral motion by his temple. \"ben\\'s a little unusual,\" he said. when he got home, he found a message from annie waiting for him on his voice mail. \"hi, frank, i\\'m down here in atlanta.\" pause. \"i\\'m calling you because... something weird is happening,\" she continued in an urgent voice. \"and i think it might... anyway, there\\'ve been these strange outbreaks of flu in different parts of the country - strange because it\\'s the wrong time of the year for it, you know? i didn\\'t think too much about it until i got down here. but it\\'s an archival flu -\" she hesitated. \"what i mean by that is..., oh, i wish you were there, i hate talking to machines. anyway, the thing is, what\\'s happened can\\'t be a natural occurrence, because -\" and here the machine cut her off. the second message began: \"the thing is, there\\'s no way this flu could occur in four separate places! and there\\'s something else...\" she took a deep breath, and sighed. \"this is too frustrating. i\\'ll be back tomorrow. we can talk then.\" frank played the messages again, and frowned, what the hell was an \"archival flu\\'? he found her at home at one o\\'clock the next afternoon. \"i\\'m on the phone,\" she said, rushing back to the kitchen. he followed her. \"take a look at those,\" she said with her hand over the telephone, gesturing toward some papers on the kitchen table. \"not yet,\" she said, speaking into the receiver again. \"i\\'m heading over to the lab as soon as i catch my breath.\" the papers turned out to be two issues of something called mmwr, which was put out by the centers for disease control. the acronym, frank saw, stood for morbidity and mortality weekly report. the headline of the lead segment, under the banner \"epidemiologic notes and reports,\" read: influenza a outbreaks california - on april 18, the california department of health (cdh) initiated an investigation of an outbreak of acute respiratory illness reported by area sentinel physicians, urgent care facilities, and hospital emergency rooms in the los angeles metropolitan area. during april 4-11, 1,395 cases were reported, of which 1,011 had a documented temperature of >100 f. (37.8c) and cough. patients ranged in age from 34 to 99 years. 67 were hospitalized; 9 had radiographic signs of pneumonia. onset of similar symptoms was reported by 27 of 142 reporting medical care facility staff members. unusual prolongation of acute phase noted in many patients, along with attenuated recovery phase. testing by cdc-supplied reagents of 1997-98 circulating influenza strains failed to produce conclusive identification. amantadine was administered for treatment. annie was scribbling on a pad of paper. \"maybe tonight,\" she said. \"if i\\'m lucky. sure, day or night.\" frank continued leafing through the mmwrs, concentrating on the sections reporting influenza',\n",
       " 'outbreaks. apart from the outbreak in california, there were similar reports of infection from washington, d.c.; madison, wisconsin; and daytona beach, florida. \"thanks, ozzie. yeah,\" annie said. she hung up and dropped into the chair opposite him, looking very tired. \"what are we going to do?\" she asked. \"there\\'s no medical solution to this. there\\'s not enough amantadine to protect the population of washington, let alone -\" \"what are you talking about?\" frank asked. \"this just looks like a bunch of people who got the flu. and it can\\'t be our flu, because they didn\\'t get sick enough. no one died. so... what\\'s the big deal?\" \"you\\'re right. it\\'s not our flu. not yet. but these people that got sick - they didn\\'t just get the flu, frank. first of all, flu cases in april are rare, and in may - the wisconsin and florida outbreaks - exceedingly rare. it\\'s the only reason we\\'re even aware of it, frankly. the first outbreak, in l.a. - initially, they didn\\'t even test for flu. if it had occurred a month or two earlier, we wouldn\\'t have a clue that this weird flu bug was even out there.\" \"what do you mean that they didn\\'t just get the flu?\" \"they got an archival flu, that\\'s what i was trying to tell you on the telephone.\" \"what -\" she was up and pacing. \"i just talked to a friend from cdc. most of us have access to a genomic database that stores the nucleotide sequences of flu strains - it\\'s how we track what\\'s out there, how we do comparative studies, how we spot new variants. well, the results from wisconsin and florida are in now, and they match what we found out about the bugs in l.a. and d.c. all these people who got sick, frank - people in four different geographical locations - they got a flu that is genetically identical to a strain called...\" she paused, to look at the white pad next to the telephone. \"a-beijing-2-82.\" she threw her hands out to the side. \"well, that just doesn\\'t happen.\" \"why not? what\\'s \"a-beijing -\"\" \"it\\'s a strain of influenza that was first identified in china. in february, \"eighty-two. and here it is again. but that can\\'t happen, frank. influenza is in a constant state of mutation. that\\'s what influenza does. it\\'s unstable. it mutates. you don\\'t get exact replicas of sixteen-year-old strains.\" \"but we did.\" \"down at cdc - this is the mystery du jour. when it was just the outbreak out in l.a., they thought it was an accidental lab release and the epidemiologists were giving all the labs hell, trying to track down the source.\" \"what do you mean?\" \"virologists, pharmaceutical labs, epidemiologists, people in the vaccine industry — we all work with old strains of flu sometimes, to study them. occasionally, there\\'s an accidental release. it\\'s happened. that was the logical explanation for the l.a. outbreak - until the same strain popped up in washington. and then in wisconsin. and then in florida.\" \"but what if people infected with the strain in la. got on a plane? wouldn\\'t that explain it?\" \"no because the pattern\\'s wrong. if that happened, you\\'d get little clusters of infection here and there. that probably has happened, in fact. but no one\\'s going to notice it because people are not getting',\n",

       " 'on. so something is making the infection persist, or somehow preventing the immune system from kicking in. it\\'s as if the virus had been camouflaged somehow.\" \"is that possible?\" she squeezed her eyes shut, then opened them again. \"i\\'m worried that whoever did this has tinkered with the genome in a way that inhibits the immune response. with a-beijing-2-82, it\\'s no big deal. it was a mild strain. but if they did this to the 1918 flu... \"what?\" she stared at him. \"annie. what?\" \"well, you\\'d kill almost everybody who got it. the only recourse would be global immunization.\" there was a beat, and then annie smiled and waved her hand crazily in the air and started talking too fast. \"i\\'m probably just a lunatic. maybe the beijing strain was a particularly long-lasting flu, and we just don\\'t have enough data about it because it was so mild.\" she stopped. \"but i want to take a look because one thing\\'s for sure.\" she slapped the mmwrs. \"these were tests!\" \"i\\'ll call gleason,\" frank said. on the way back to his apartment from annie\\'s, he stopped at mixtec and grabbed some lunch. while annie was at the lab, he\\'d print out his notes about the temple. he intended to fashion some concise document about the chain of events and evidence -something even gleason couldn\\'t ignore. and if they got nowhere with him, he was thinking maybe they\\'d go to fema. call tom deer. whatever. his door was open. at first he thought maybe he\\'d forgotten to lock it. and then he went into the room that was both his bedroom and his study. even then it took him a second to register what was wrong. his keyboard was there, his monitor was there, his printer was there - but the cpu was gone. and so was his laptop. his filing cabinets were empty. his zip drive was gone. there were no diskettes at all, not anywhere - his entire archive was missing. \"fuck,\" he said, and just stood there for several moments, thinking about how much of his life was now missing. it wasn\\'t his current work he was worried about - or not much - because most of that would be on the backup diskettes he kept in the refrigerator. it was everything else. his personal letters. his running log. his address book. tax records. the rage rose in his chest. it was a primitive, powerful feeling, akin to the way a dog or a wolf might feel on returning to its lair and finding the scent of an interloper. if he were a dog, his hackles would have been up. instead, he followed the conditioned response of a citizen of the late twentieth century: he headed for the telephone to complain to the police. not that it would do any good. it was just what you did, a routine he knew personally because two years ago, his stereo and tv had been ripped off. the call was made, not because the police would find his stolen stuff and punish those who took it. it was made because the insurance company required a police report or it wouldn\\'t pay.',\n",
       " 'it was only then, as he was reaching for the telephone, that it dawned on him that this wasn\\'t a gardenvariety robbery, that the theft had been a theft of information, that his television, monitor, stereo, and speakers - none of those had been touched. and in the instant he composed that thought, he knew who was responsible. it was just then, as he lifted the receiver to call the police, that something slammed into the back of his head, driving him toward the floor. on the way down, his head hit the telephone table and a spray of sparks fanned across his eyes. a second later the man was on him, and frank could feel his breath. an arm went around his neck, and there was a whiff of something sickly sweet, a hospital smell that could only be chloroform. a hand went over his mouth, clamping a damp rag to his face. frank thrashed. rolled. struggled. and, finally, went limp, holding his breath. he lay that way for what seemed a long time but could only have been a relatively few seconds. his lungs were in a panic, his heart pounding, but he could feel his attacker relaxing, just a little, just enough. frank exploded beneath him, driving his head into the man\\'s face, sending him sprawling. then he lurched to his feet, intending to kick the guy while he was still on the ground. but the man was too quick, and frank too woozy. the intruder spun away from the kick, rolled and scrambled to his feet. frank got a look: black jeans and t-shirt, gingery hair, and a round white face with a bright stain of blood around the mouth and nose. frank lurched after him, but was slowed by the pain in his ribs, which didn\\'t allow him to straighten up. the man got to the door before him and yanked it open. \"claude!\" he shouted then stepped outside and slammed the door shut. frank reached for the doorknob, but it wouldn\\'t turn. his assailant was pulling from the other side and the door wouldn\\'t open, until, an instant later, it exploded inward, driving its sharp edge into frank\\'s forehead. he reeled backward, and in the wide-open doorway, caught sight of his assailant\\'s bloody face, and behind him, another man, dark and scowling. the stink of chloroform filled the air. it was fear that drove him forward, but it was football that saved him. he knew how to hit. he saw that round face in the doorway, and the other man\\'s behind it, saw the chloroform rag in his hand - and he put his head down and drove into them. the attack took them by surprise; they were off balance and stumbling backward near the top of the stairs. he kept driving until, in the end, the three of them were tumbling down the stairs in a pained tangle of knocked heads and flailing limbs. then a quavering voice threaded itself into the din: \"hey! what the hell is going on here?\" frank\\'s assailants were on their feet by the time they hit the ground floor. they launched themselves at the front door, bouncing carlos - his neighbor - out of the way and sending his groceries flying. \"hey!\" he squeaked. frank pulled himself up by the banister and rushed out into the street, but it was too late. he watched the men jump into a black van, double-parked halfway up the block. he started after them, hoping he could get close enough to catch the license number, when the truck pulled out and accelerated. \"jesus christ,\" he moaned. this was getting painful.',\n",

       " 'chapter 27 ozzie vilas had done most of the prep work at cdc, and annie was glad he had. an electron microscope scans a field of approximately one millionth of a millimeter. viruses are exceedingly small - several million virions could fit inside a comma. but in tissue or blood, they were dispersed, and moreover, the number present depended on the status of the infection. in order to be able to find virus to look at, without a frustrating and lengthy search, viral samples were cultured, often in layers of green monkey kidney cells and then concentrated through the use of high-speed centrifuges. sometimes, virus was replicated through a technology called pcr. the viral sample ozzie provided to herself and dr. kicklighter had already been concentrated and then pelletized, the viral material dispersed within a resin. the resulting tiny, hard pellets were put in tubes, the tubes packed in cotton, and encased inside a metal container with the biohazard flower imprinted on the exterior. nih had any number of electron microscopists who were skilled at preparing grids and searching for pathogens. annie used them extensively, because she was not fond of spending time with the electron microscope looking for viral footprints. the microscope itself was a clunky affair, about the size of an old-fashioned telephone booth, and always housed in its own separate room - which was usually in the basement. because of the need for absolute steadiness, the room was heavily insulated and balanced on struts. that\\'s what annie disliked about it. it was a dead room with the ambience of a bell jar. spending time in it was like being buried alive. she stashed her belongings in her office and went through the laborious procedure of dressing to deal with an infectious agent. that done, she put a pellet into place and rotated the diamond blade of the resin machine toward it, shaving off a number of tiny, angstrom-thick slices of the viral pellet. the machine dispensed these onto a pool of liquid. then came the tricky part - picking up the tiny round \"grid\" that would be inserted into the microscope and trying to get one of the viral samples onto it. the \"grid\" itself was a tiny disk, an eighth of an inch in diameter, the size of a very small button or pill. it was scored with a viewing matrix. the trick was to grasp the curved lip of this disk with microdissection tweezers and \"catch\" or \"scoop\" one of the floating slices of viral material off the liquid so that the slice adhered properly to the surface of the viewing grid. she stared at the floating slices of virus and looked for one with the glint of gold. the gold ones were the thinnest slices, and therefore the best. the thinner the slice, the more likely you were to isolate a recognizable viral sample from what was always a distracting mess of visual material. two samples draped over the lip of the disk and had to be discarded. a third tore when she tried to float it onto the grid. and then, on the brink of success, she started to cough at the worst possible moment, just as she maneuvered the grid under a perfect gold slice. she lost it, of course, and it took three more tries before she got one. god, she was sick of this flu. and now, she was going to see what it actually looked like. she placed the grid into place in the \"box,\" and snapped the box into the microscope and turned it on. it took almost an hour to find what she was',\n",
       " 'looking for and, of course, when she did, and ratcheted up the magnification, she couldn\\'t find it for a while. when she finally located it again, she frowned. influenza virus resembles a round ball with a large number of spikes and knobs protruding from its surface. the spikes are the antigens, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, and they grab onto the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract. in each strain of virus, the spikes are shaped differently. when the immune system is alert to a particular strain through previous infection or vaccination, the body\\'s immuno-globulin recognizes the spikes, and responds to their presence by locking onto them and neutralizing them. but in the case of the viral sample she was looking at, the spikes looked... strange. they were unlike any influenza sample she\\'d ever seen. they seemed almost slimy - sort of gooey and indistinct, as if the surface proteins were covered by a viscous gel. she frowned. often, you couldn\\'t really be sure of what you were looking at when on the microscope itself. things tended to become clearer when you made a print. she went through the process of producing a micrograph. some of the newer machines were hooked up to computers, allowing the operator to simply store a series of images - which could then be colorized and put through various visual manipulations that clarified the images. time on those machines was strictly rationed, apportioned like viewing time on a famous telescope. annie was working with an old machine. it was fitted out so that it made a glass plate negative, which could be exposed through an enlarger just like any other photographic negative. she made several positive prints - certain the cdc would want a copy -hung most of them to dry, and took one of the wet prints out to her office. she wanted to compare it with existing micrographs of a-beijing-2-82 - which were on a computer database. she logged onto the central nih database and maneuvered her way into the visual archive of influenza virus samples. she tapped in the search term, then waited for the graphic display to fill in. this took a maddening amount of time because her computer was old and poky. when a-beij ing-2-82 was there on the screen in front her, she shook her head. it was identical to the image on her micrograph and yet it was not the same. the image on the screen was sharp and clear, without the indistinct look of its counterpart. yet their structure was the same. she didn\\'t get it. she tapped a few keys and made a print of the computer sample. ozzie had also given her slides from immuno-fluorescence tests on the virus. this was the way most strains of influenza were identified. samples were subjected to antibodies from known strains that had been tagged with radioactive markers that made them fluorescent. under a fluorescent microscope, when the antibodies from a particular strain encountered antigens of the same strain, the virus lit up brilliantly, bright as neon. in this case, what she saw was very strange. a few viral particles lit up, but with a dim glow, not the bright radiance that was normal. there should also have been many, many more viral particles than she was seeing in the faint scatter of light. it was as if some of the virus was invisible to the antibodies, and even when it was visible, the marker effect was tremendously diminished. she practically ran to doctor k\\'s office, where they talked, and then took turns peering at ozzie\\'s samples under the fluorescent microscope. doctor k wanted to make sure that the initial slide wasn\\'t anomalous. but there they were again - not a dense cloud of bright stars, but a scattering of dim ones. \"i\\'ll be damned,\" he said. \"it\\'s as if the receptors are somehow inhibited from locking onto the antigens.\" it was the known antibodies that were tagged; the visible fluorescent reaction occurred when they found the viral antigens they were specific for and locked onto them. in this case, the antigens were',\n",
       " 'there, all right, but the antibodies were not finding them. \"right,\" annie said, \"and you know, i think it\\'s that... goo. it repels the b-cells.\" \"no wonder people are staying sick for so long. and you think someone\\'s spliced it to repress immune response?\" \"well, if not to repress, at least to delay the response. i mean we are seeing those dim reactions, so maybe the b-cells eventually get the picture.\" \"right.\" \"it reminds me of measles,\" annie said suddenly. measles was another rna virus structurally similar to influenza. and like the influenza strain they were looking at, the measles virus interfered with b lymphocyte production of immunoglobulin. by the time she and doctor k finished a conference call with ozzie and others at cdc, annie was exhausted. she couldn\\'t stop yawning. now she understood why this flu was dragging on like it was. with her own immune response repressed, she was like an aids patient. dr. kicklighter was still on the phone when annie finally packed up her briefcase. she knocked on his doorjamb and gave him a little wave before she headed out. he returned the wave without looking at her. the two of them had talked about the possibility that he might be needed to speak to the fbi, and he had agreed - if somewhat reluctantly. he was more excited about the scientific implications of the altered virus than he was concerned about what it might mean vis-a-vis the cult\\'s plans for the spanish flu. \"it\\'s amazing,\" she heard him say into the receiver. \"it\\'s as if the virus is exuding teflon, you know? i\\'d love to know how it was done, because if you could turn this inside out, and enhance the immune response...\" annie was very tired as she walked to her car, and despite the warm night, she shivered with cold. cones of light shone down from the mercury vapor lamps. she could hear the surf sounds of traffic from wisconsin avenue and the beltway. whatever energy she\\'d had, she\\'d expended in the lab, and it seemed like a very long trudge through the immense and largely deserted nih lot. she was relieved when she finally got to her honda. she just wanted to go home and go to bed. she was waiting to turn into the main exit lane that would put her on wisconsin avenue when the car hit her. her body jolted forward at the sharp impact. metal crumpled against metal. the seat belt had a kind of slingshot effect, and when she reached its restraining limit, her body bounced back hard against the seat. rear-ended. oh... no, she thought, just what i need. she blew her nose and wearily unfastened her seat belt to get out and take a look. she already knew there was enough damage that she\\'d have to go through that whole tiresome routine of getting insurance numbers and maybe even waiting for the police. the young man who\\'d run into her was already out of his car, looking at her crumpled fender with a heartbroken expression on his face. he had a baseball cap on backward. \"oh man,\" he said, shaking his head sadly. \"my dad\\'s gonna kill me.\" the fender was tilted and bent. the license plate hung by one corner. pieces of the shattered taillight lay on the asphalt. \"i\\'m so sorry, ma\\'am. i just -\" she stood at the',\n",
       " 'juncture of the cars - his big black van looming above her little civic. the left rear wheel looked to be pinned by the crumpled fender. he stepped up next to her. \"you reckon we should call the police?\" \"i guess,\" annie said. a u-haul truck pulled up next to them. a red-haired man leaned out the window. \"you need help out there?\" he didn\\'t wait for a reply, but got out and joined them. \"whoa,\" he said to the kid. \"you really nailed her.\" \"yeah, i -\" and then the van guy threw his arm around her shoulders, crumpling her against his body, and shoved a damp, sweet-smelling rag against her mouth and nose. wild-eyed, she saw and heard the back door of the u-haul fly open. panicked now, she struggled and writhed, but it only took a second and then she was inside the van. and so was someone else. and then the door closed and the lights went off inside her head. there was a tall cop and a short cop - a mutt and jeff combination that made frank wonder who played the good cop and who played the bad cop when it came time to play those games. \"you got insurance?\" mutt asked. he was looking at the doorjamb, studying the dead bolt. frank said that he did. \"in that case, i\\'d recommend you change the locks. you\\'re gonna be way over the deductible anyway, and most times they cover that. you could do better than this lock.\" he handed frank a slip of paper with the number of the police report. \"you got any way to find out your serial numbers - i\\'m talking about the computers -phone \"em on in. although chances are, you never going to see those babies again. they chop \"em up, just like cars. this time next week, your motherboard\\'s in hong kong, your hard drive\\'s in mexico.\" he nodded to his partner and they headed for the door. \"that\\'s it?\" carlos said. \"that\\'s all you going to do? you take the fingerprints. you talk to frank. you ask him what happened. what about me? i want to give a statement. in fact, when these men are ever apprehended, i want to press charges for assault.\" frank was bored, the cops were bored, but carlos remained in a state of high excitement. the tall cop - whom frank thought of as \"jeff -gave carlos a look. \"excuse me?\" \"i want a police artist involved. i want the description of these men circulated. i, personally, would like to view the lineup when that time comes. i am a corroborative witness.\" mutt looked at carlos. \"you watch a lot of television, mister...?\" \"carlos,\" frank interrupted, \"i think the officers have -\" \"rubini,\" carlos said emphatically, ignoring frank.',\n",
       " '\"my name is carlos rubini. and as far as your resources are concerned, you act like this was a simple burglary, and it was not. it was a kidnap attempt. a very serious crime. a capital crime, if i\\'m not mistaken. you have to do something. as a citizen, i am not satisfied with your response. look at this man.\" carlos jabbed a finger toward frank. he\\'d cleaned up, but he looked like he\\'d been in a brawl. his right eye was fading to black and, on the way down the stairs, he\\'d ripped open the recently healed stitches in his finger and thumb. that was the biggest problem. he couldn\\'t seem to get it to stop bleeding. the hand was wrapped in a towel, and although this was the third one, it was still soaking through. the tall cop tossed frank a \"this guy\\'s a real prize\" look. \"seems to me,\" he said, \"mr. daly disturbed these dirt-bags in the middle of a burglary. i didn\\'t hear anything about any weapons. so, the way i see it,\" the cop continued, \"one man was carrying stolen objects down to the vee-hicle — which, this being adams-morgan, and there being a whole line of other double-parked vehicles in the way - was half a block away instead of right out front. so, we got burglar b toting stuff to the car, burglar a still in here scoping out what else to take - when mr. daly comes home. the inside man steps into the closet. i think that\\'s the likely scenario. when mr. daly reaches for the telephone to call 911, the guy comes out of the closet. so to speak. mr. daly?\" frank shrugged. \"sounds about right.\" carlos frowned and expanded his chest. \"this is not right. why, then, do they take frank\\'s papers?\" the short cop had been talking into a cellular telephone, and when he was finished, he had a suspicious look on his face. \"desk sergeant says we were out here a few days ago. something about drugs. that have anything to do with this?\" \"\"something about drugs,\"\" carlos said indignantly. \"this man is poisoned, he could have been killed, and now i\\'m hearing innuendo.\" mutt shrugged and said he didn\\'t mean to imply anything. \"i hope not,\" carlos said sharply. \"they take your papers, your computer,\" mutt said. \"you said you\\'re a reporter, right?\" frank nodded. \"so... you working on something... might get someone upset?\" frank wanted them to leave. the cops, carlos, everyone. he wanted to call and see how annie had made out at the lab, and then he wanted to go to her place and work on the thing he was writing for gleason. he shook his head. \"no,\" he said, \"i\\'m just working on a story about the flu.\" when the police were gone, carlos expressed his disappointment in his squeaky, officious voice. \"really, frank - you know this was not a burglary. i will tell you this: a citizenry gets the government it demands.\" he wagged his finger. \"you should not let them get away with their slipshod ways. how will they ever do better?\" frank tried not to smile. \"i\\'m sorry, carlos. and i really appreciate your help. if you hadn\\'t come in just when you did... anyway, i\\'m just kind of wrecked.\" \"i am going to speak to the super about installing a new exterior lock downstairs. will you support me',\n",
       " 'in this?\" \"absolutely.\" \"i don\\'t like it,\" carlos said, \"that someone can just waltz in here,\" he gestured to frank\\'s hand, \"you want me to drive you to the emergency room? i think you should have stitches.\" \"that\\'s all right. my girlfriend can take me there later.\" annie\\'s phone was busy. frank threw some water on his face and carefully cleaned off the blood with a washcloth. then he poured half a bottle of hydrogen peroxide over his hand and watched it fizz up into pink froth around the cuts in his finger and thumb. he wrapped them up in gauze and fastened it with adhesive tape. annie\\'s phone was still busy, so he headed down the stairs and drove to her place. if she wasn\\'t home, indu would let him in, and he could wait for her. and when he knocked, it was indu who answered. she pulled aside the curtain and peered out at him, then quickly unlocked the door. \"annie\\'s not here, frank,\" she said, her forehead creased into a frown. \"in fact, i\\'m a little worried. please,\" she added, stepping to the side and pulling the door open. \"come in.\" \"worried,\" he said. \"why?\" in the hall light, she got a good look at him. \"oh my goodness, what happened to you?\" he ignored that. \"why are you worried about annie?\" indu\\'s smooth brown face knotted up into a puzzled frown. \"the police called about her car.\" \"what about her car?\" \"they found it in the nih lot - abandoned.\" frank felt as if the air had gone out of the room. \"abandoned,\" he said. \"well, they said it had been in a fender bender of some sort. but - annie - why would she not call a tow truck? she\\'s not going to just leave her car there, frank. i\\'m worried that she was hurt, that maybe she\\'s in the hospital.\" \"when was this?\" \"they called, oh, just half an hour ago.\" he spent the next hour on the phone. first he hit all the hospitals. annie was not in any emergency room. then he called the police - d.c., bethesda, park police, maryland cops. no one had called 911 or the alternative \"nonemergency\" number to report the accident. nih security had spotted the car and reported it to the police. \"i\\'m really worried, frank. what if she\\'s - i don\\'t know, wandering around, dazed or something.\" she hesitated and brightened. \"maybe she\\'s at your house - you think it\\'s possible?\" he called. no, she wasn\\'t there, but maybe she\\'d left a message. the phone had been knocked off the hook in the struggle. if she\\'d called while it was off the hook, she\\'d have gotten his voice mail. he called it, tapping in the number for his mailbox. the neutral female voice informed him that he had',\n",
       " 'three messages. the first two were from annie - her flipped-out calls from atlanta, raving about archival flu and tests. he\\'d forgotten to delete them. the third call was only half an hour old, and it made the hair stand up on the back of his neck when he heard it. the voice was mechanically altered, an electronic drone that surged through the phone with an inhuman timbre. missing something?\" there was a rat-a-tat-tat laugh. and then, a hideous, mock version of part of annie\\'s message from the night before: \"oh, frank, i wish you were there. i hate talking to machines.\" the rat-a-tat-tat laugh again. \"so here\\'s the deal. you want to see your girlfriend again? take a walk in the light, buddy.\" \"what?\" indu said, when he hung up the telephone. \"did she call? what is it?\" \"i think she\\'s been kidnapped.\" \"what?\" her big brown eyes were wild under the knotted eyebrows. but he was up and on his way out the door. \"frank! where are you going?\" he stopped long enough to ask the terrified indu to file a missing person\\'s report and ran out to his car. he jumped into the saab and cranked and cranked, but the engine wouldn\\'t catch. fuck! in frustration, and forgetting the two injured fingers, he slammed his hand hard against the dashboard, a stab of pain shot through his hand, followed by a deep ache that seemed to pin him against the seat for a second. and then he was out, and running. the streets of mount pleasant and adams-morgan were crowded, as always, and he was weaving in and out of alarmed yuppies and puzzled kids and worried-looking women, making deft cuts and swerves and dangerous slashes between moving cars. a panhandler stationed outside the mcdonald\\'s put his hand up like a traffic cop. \"hey!\" he was obsessed with the idea that he had to get to his phone before anyone else called to leave a message. the thing was, he knew the fuckhead who\\'d left the message would certainly have blocked caller id using 67. but frank had a voice-mail system called omnipoint, which circumvented the blocking device and displayed the number of the last caller. thank god he\\'d hung up before the system answered when he\\'d called from annie\\'s. he pounded up his stairs, and there it was. a 914 exchange. he headed for his computer, hoping to check the number on his reverse directory. and then he remembered that he didn\\'t have a computer. carlos hesitated before letting frank in, but then grudgingly opened the door. the thing was, carlos was the ultimate computer geek, with the newest and best of everything, and within two minutes he\\'d chased down the number for frank. \"it is a poughkeepsie number,\" carlos said in his high-pitched voice. \"in new york. for martin kramer associates. do you know these people?\" \"yeah,\" frank said. \"i know him.\" frank flashed back to their lunch at fernacci\\'s. coupla squirrels, kramer said. bigots. paranoid. looking under the rugs for land mines. \"you want the address?\" carlos asked. \"no thanks,\" frank said. \"i know where he lives.\"',\n",

       " 'he thought about calling the feds, but after waco and ruby ridge, the bureau did not inspire confidence where hostage-rescue operations were involved. he\\'d try a different tack. half an hour later he stapled the jetpak closed. it contained the diskette from his refrigerator, with all the information that he\\'d compiled about the temple, the spanish flu, and luc solange. it also held a memo, hastily composed on carlos\\'s computer, which sketched out the information not on the diskette up to and including what annie had said about the mmwrs, her guess that the recent outbreaks were dispersal tests, her kidnapping, and his own plans. knowing gleason\\'s relentless skepticism, he included his voice-mail codes so the fbi agent could listen to the threatening message from the temple, which he had not deleted. carlos (the citizen) rubini solemnly promised to deliver the package to gleason\\'s office at buzzard point the following morning. carlos was starry-eyed with excitement at frank\\'s insistence that the less he knew, the safer he would be. carlos was to insist that gleason himself should come down to fetch the jetpak. if gleason was not there, carlos would say that it was a matter of urgency, a national security matter, and that the jetpak must be delivered to gleason instantly. \"don\\'t worry, frank,\" carlos said, eyes gleaming. \"i will make certain this reaches mr. gleason. i knew that was not a simple burglary. i was not fooled.\" with his fallback position taken care of, frank thought about going across the border to virginia and buying a gun. but then he discarded the idea. a gun might be useful, but only if he had a functioning right hand. just driving was going to be enough of a challenge. and as for driving, he decided not to screw around with the saab. what if it crapped out on him somewhere along the way? besides, an automatic would be easier to handle. so he grabbed a taxi to national, rented a car from budget, put his head down and drove. north. by the time he hit delaware, a hard rain was pounding the windshield. the side windows kept fogging up. the car was hydroplaning. he was propelled by an irrational sense that as long as he pursued annie, as long as he was intent on her rescue, she\\'d be okay. it was magical thinking, but it was what kept him going, speeding steadily north in the rain. he fought off images of what might be happening to her. he fought off benny stern\\'s voice in his head. you know the one thing they never did: they never tried to kill me. but they would have if i\\'d been anything more than a nuisance. he played music - loud - and concentrated on driving. every now and then a big semi rocked by, smashing the windshield with water, obliterating his vision. because it was a distraction and took him away from his worries, he almost enjoyed his own terror at these moments: he was sightless, in a tunnel of noise, hurtling through the rain. he pulled into lake placid at about four a.m. it had finally stopped raining. then he was on the other side of town, driving through the country, passing only a few houses. the older ones stood close to the road; the newer ones were set back at the end of long driveways. once his headlights caught a clutch of deer in a field, just by the edge of the road. they stood motionless as he approached, and then they bolted into the darkness. there were no lights, anywhere, in any of the houses. not a porch light, not the blue shimmer of a television, nothing. the rain had stopped and the landscape glowed under a fat moon that cast a ghostly radiance on the rolling terrain. once out of town, he didn\\'t pass a single car. the emptiness pressed down on him. i\\'m alone in the world, he thought. everyone else is dead. he passed the white clapboard house that he remembered from his visit to the temple. behind it he saw the gates to the compound. he pulled the car off the road, humping it up on a grassy shoulder. he knew',\n",
       " \"that gates and a guardhouse controlled the road leading into the compound - so that vehicular traffic in and out was clearly monitored - but he hadn't noticed any kind of wall. he didn't have even a rudimentary plan. somewhere, away from the gates, he'd walk into the woods. and then? he didn't know. he'd look for annie. find her. take her home. he ran alongside the road, moving at a jog, so jazzed on adrenaline and nerves that he could hear the blood thrumming in his ears. he left the road and angled in through the trees. the moonlight was dazzling, the trees silver and black. it was an old forest, a groomed forest, so that given the ambient light and the space between the trees, walking was easy. the ground was carpeted with needles, spongy and soft underfoot. it was so quiet he could hear the whirs and chirps of insects, or maybe they were birds, and every now and then the skitter of an animal. after a while the woods got thicker and darker. it was slow going, moving by touch, and the branches of the trees slapped at him, reaching out through the dark, grabbing at his face with stiff fingers. and then, suddenly, he was in a clearing, and not just a clearing, but a parking lot. gravel crunched under his feet. the moon was down, but in the afterglow he saw cars, drained of color by the thin light, neatly arrayed against the sides of the square. they had a malevolent, hard-shelled look, like ranks of black beetles. he looked at his watch. the luminous dial read 5:10. beyond the parking lot he saw a gravel path, which disappeared into the trees. he took the path and emerged a little while later in another clearing. this time, a meadow. off to the right he could detect a slight brightening in the sky, the faintest apricot glow that must be either the first glimmer of dawn or the wash of light pollution from a settlement of some sort. he passed a pond and tennis courts. then buildings - a cluster of white cottages, and past them, some larger shapes which, when he got closer, turned out to be old brick dormitories. a campus. he almost said the word aloud, he was so relieved to get a fix on what in the dark had seemed so mysterious. a campus: that snapped it into focus, that brought it down to size. now he remembered stern talking about it. an old private school, something like that. he was walking uphill now, where the path widened into a service road. when he crested the hill, he almost gasped at the sight of a complex of modern glass and steel structures: a factory, a warehouse, office-type buildings. it was so sleek, so big, so clean and expensive-looking, a little industrial park hidden away in the woods. and from the complex came a set of noises different from the sounds in the woods: an automated hum, a faint mechanical chatter. parts of the complex were lighted, operating - the whole area exuded a kind of cool, fluorescent glow. roads ran between the buildings. a couple of large trucks were backed up to the bay of the warehouse, their white sides emblazoned with a setting sun and the words eco-vita. so far he had not seen a single human being, but he sensed that they were present, working inside this complex. making virus? despite tom deer's assertion that making virus was about as difficult as whipping up a vat of home brew, he found that he'd been harboring a secret hope that the temple would not be up to the task, that they'd screw it up. seeing the size and scope of the operation here, that hope died. beyond the steel and glass buildings, frank could see another stand of trees. and beyond that, perched high on the hill, with old-fashioned globe lights marking the winding drive that led up to it, stood a large house. a mansion.\",\n",
       " 'chez solange. he wanted to skirt the buildings, and to do that he was forced to sidetrack, back into the woods. by the time he\\'d angled around, the sky had brightened considerably. he was able to move faster, so that he was soon next to the woods that stood between the factory complex and the mansion. this was an old forest of tiger-tail spruce, each tree trunk as straight as a pencil. here, close to the mansion, the lower branches of the trees had been pruned away so it was possible to walk beneath the canopy. there was no deadwood anywhere; it was maintained like parkland. frank leaned against a tree to catch his breath. a whirring sound made him look up. it was a sound he\\'d heard often as he made his way through the compound, a bird, a bug, one of the night sounds. so his glance was instinctual. he didn\\'t really expect to see anything. but he did. and what he saw almost made his heart stop. it was a tiny red light attached to a surveillance camera. the camera swiveled as he looked at it, a mechanical adjustment of angle. it swept right with a tiny whir and then stopped, adjusted, swept left. his heart sank. he wasn\\'t sure if the machines were infrared sensors or surveillance cameras, but he knew that the whirring sound had been with him all along. he\\'d been monitored ever since he entered the compound. still, surveillance cameras didn\\'t mean a thing if no one was paying attention. besides, he sure as hell wasn\\'t going back to the car. he was going to find annie and get her out of this. there had to be a way. he\\'d planned to stay clear of the mansion\\'s manicured grounds, its carefully lighted and landscaped drive. he\\'d planned to keep to the edge of the woods, where the light was better, and make his way just inside the perimeter of the trees. loop up behind the mansion. have a look-see. instead, he found himself standing in a floodlight, bathed in its hard brilliance, blinded. a woman\\'s voice said, \"step into the clearing, please, and keep your hands visible.\" he was shackled, hands and feet, and dumped into a small room that had nothing in it save a recessed light in the ceiling and a toilet bowl in the corner. he was allowed that glimpse and then the light was turned off. it was impossible to say how long he was in the room, because he had no way to gauge the passing of time. he thought it was at least twenty-four hours, but who knew? the faint rim of light around the door never varied in its intensity. certainly, he was in the room long enough to get very hungry and thirsty. long enough so he dozed off several times, each time waking in a sort of disoriented stupor that began to seem preferable to full consciousness. long enough so he began to worry that either he\\'d been forgotten or, worse, left in the room to die. and then the door opened and out of the dazzle stepped two armed men. they gave him water, and then took him to another room, this one far different. \"can i offer you some refreshment?\" solange asked. \"you look as if you could use a little something.\" they sat across from one another, at an oak library table set atop a fine old bokhara, in a room that was a masterpiece of burnished woodwork. it had an elaborate coffered ceiling, floor-to-ceiling bookcases, rolling library ladders, one wall of low cabinets topped by a bank of mullioned windows. beneath an',\n",
       " 'intricately carved mantel, a fire snapped cheerfully. there were two doors into the room, fan-shaped windows above, mullioned side windows in amber glass. flanking each door were a man and a woman, each dressed in blue jeans and a white shirt. they held what looked to frank like ingram submachine guns. these were small weapons, black, compact, efficient-looking. none of the guards had so much as looked at him. they were as impassive as the guards stationed in front of buckingham palace. frank had been in the room for more than an hour, trussed to a chair. finally, solange had arrived, and sat down. \"where\\'s annie?\" he asked. solange leaned back in his chair, tilting on two legs, something frank was unable to do. his hands were free, but his legs were bent back at the knee, secured to the chair legs with industrial fasteners - thickridged plastic strips that had self-locking buckles. he was tied to the chair in such a way that his quadriceps were pulled as tight as iron bands. the result was that he leaned forward slightly all the time, trying to ease the pressure. before solange\\'s arrival, the chair had been in the middle of the room and frank had been compelled to perform a continual, delicate balancing act. on the one hand, if he didn\\'t lean forward, the pain in his thighs became agonizing. on the other hand, if he leaned too far forward, the chair would clearly become unbalanced and he would fall on his face. at solange\\'s arrival, the chair was carried to the table - a tremendous relief to frank because he could lean forward to ease the strain on his legs without worrying about balance. between the two men, on the table, sat a tray of cheese and fruit, a decanter of wine, and two empty glasses. solange poured wine into one glass, swirled it around, sniffed, then finally took a small sip, rolling it around in his mouth. he looked at frank, a fake frown of concern curling his heavy eyebrows. \"you\\'re sure?\" he said. \"this is a really excellent claret.\" \"where is she?\" he said. \"i wouldn\\'t turn it down if i were you, frank,\" solange said. \"why not enjoy, while you can?\" \"why not go fuck yourself?\" solange winced, then wagged his head indulgently, as if frank were a willful toddler. a sip of wine, a sigh. then he sprang to his feet and strode to the fireplace. he had a predatory, feline walk, way up on the balls of his feet. he removed the fire screen and knelt, expertly rearranging the wood with wrought-iron tools. after a moment, a shower of sparks shot up, and the fire, which had been smoldering, leapt into flames. solange replaced the tools and the screen and regarded his handiwork. without turning his head, he raised a summoning hand and one of the guards, a freckle-faced kid so young the ingram looked like a toy in his hand, approached. solange said something and the kid left the room. solange returned to his place across from frank and sat down again. he put his wine aside, made a steeple with his hands and rested his chin on them, regarding frank with a curious gaze. \"you interest me, frank. why did you come here? i mean - what were you thinking of? not that we aren\\'t grateful, but... really!\" his eyes glittered like a predator\\'s. frank said nothing. \"sure about that wine? you might find it relaxing.\"',\n",
       " 'the door opened and frank turned, hoping to see annie. but it was a thin, almost cadaverous man who stood in the doorway. solange went to him and the two men spoke briefly. the thin man left, and solange returned to his seat. he sat motionless for a few moments, then seemed to make a decision. he drummed his fingers on the table, picked up his wine and tossed it back. \"now, frank,\" he said, \"i have some questions that i know you don\\'t want to answer, but... as you can imagine, there are things i really need to know. for instance, how much of what you\\'ve learned have you shared with the fbi? hmmmm? how much?\" solange was on his feet now, and pacing, his extraordinary voice rising. \"does gleason know about the dispersal tests? does he know you\\'re here, you and dr. adair?\" frank looked up. \"now, if dr. adair is to be believed -\" \"i\\'ll fucking kill you,\" frank said. \"what did you do with her?\" \"do with her? well, we questioned her, of course. and i have to admit, she had every incentive to be truthful. still, you just never know.\" he made a signal with his hand, and the guards came over to frank. seconds later he was on his feet, his legs freed, his hands secured behind his back. solange popped a grape in his mouth, and stood up. \"let\\'s go,\" he said. that\\'s a ten thousand dollar rug, and i don\\'t want to make a mess on it.\" an elevator took them down three floors and then they were walking along a corridor, rough concrete on either side, the floor made of some rubbery, resilient material. frank\\'s legs had recovered, although they still felt watery and weak. \"this floor is made entirely out of recycled tires,\" solange said. \"it\\'s very durable, and as you can see, pleasant underfoot. do you realize how many tires there are out there? just mountains of them.\" out of his fucking mind, frank thought, trying not to think about what solange meant about \"making a mess\\' or what might be at the end of this long corridor. he didn\\'t want to go into a little room with these people. \"as far as recycling is concerned,\" solange went on, \"you can\\'t simply reimburse people for a deposit that they pay at point of purchase - because a certain percentage won\\'t give a damn about that deposit. then again, make the deposit high enough to motivate everyone and it becomes punitive to the poor. nor can you make it expensive for people to discard things, like tires. because they\\'ll just dump illegally, won\\'t they?\" \"so... what?\" frank heard himself asking. \"you make this stuff?\" i must be going nuts, frank thought. what next? a lecture about catalytic converters? \"oh yes,\" solange replied. \"we pioneered the technique - made the prototype right here. sold the rights to petrochem.\" he paused. \"i wish we had time for the tour,\" he said. \"i\\'d love to show you the facilities.\" they entered another corridor, and solange opened a door on the left. a moment later they were in a small room, concrete, with a drain on the floor. incongruously, in the middle of the room was a black metal-mesh garden table, surrounded by four matching armchairs of the same material. in the corner, a double sink. a garden hose lay coiled on the floor. there was a closed door next to the sink.',\n",
       " 'the guards pushed frank into one of the chairs. solange ran a hand through his hair. then he gave a sharp nod and one of the guards spoke into a round grill embedded in the wall near the door. a moment later the far door opened and two burly men came in, supporting annie between them. \"annie!\" her name came involuntarily out of his mouth. the figure drooping between the men did not even look up. she was heavily drugged, he saw, as the men led her closer. her eyes were glassy and unfocused, her feet barely shuffling. they lowered her into the chair and her head lolled onto her chest. \"you drugged her,\" frank said, sounding stupid to himself. solange bounced his eyebrows. \"yes, well. you know how it is.\" he tilted his head and pasted a crazy, cartoon smile on his face. \"sometimes you feel like a fuss,\" he sang, in the tune of a candy commercial. \"sometimes you don\\'t.\" \"should we get the plastic sheeting?\" one of the men asked. he set two bottles of pepsi, a church key, and a cookie tin on the table. frank stared at the bottles, thinking that solange was intent on playing the host again, and how very weird that was. they were heavy glass bottles, slightly opaque with the scuff of tiny scratches. returnable bottles. \"no,\" solange said, leaning against the wall. \"we\\'ll just hose it down when we\\'re done.\" suddenly, frank found himself tilted backward in his chair. then a wet rag was stuffed into his mouth. one of the guards put his finger over the top of the bottle and shook it up. solange, frank noticed, was smiling. the man came up to him and held the bottle under his nose. a moment later a jet of supercarbonated foam slammed through his nostrils and into his sinuses. frank thrashed uncontrollably as the pain shot through his head and every cell in his body panicked. he was drowning. he was dying. he was suffocating in a rush. and then the chair was vertical again, and the soda was running out of his nose. he felt drained. annie was weeping. \"right to the switchboard!\" solange exclaimed, laughing. \"pow!\" he began to pace, talking in an amiable tone. \"what i like about it, frank, is -\" he pulled on his fingers, each in turn.\\'- first, it\\'s low tech. secondly, it doesn\\'t use any resources. third, its not detectable. four, inflicts no permanent damage. five? you can do it over and over, and it never loses its punch.\" his hands fell to his sides and he took a deep breath. \"now, tell me about gleason. does he know you\\'re here? does he know about the dispersal tests?\" frank just looked at him. solange shrugged, and frank\\'s chair was tilted back for the second time. the rag went back in his mouth and, once again, his head exploded. then he was upright again, snuffling, tremors running through the odd body part. he watched his leg spasm - as if it were a frog\\'s leg laying on a lab tray. galvanic response. annie\\'s head lolled on her chest, her eyes closed. \"so,\" solange said. \"i was asking about gleason.\" one of the guards pulled the rag out of his mouth, but frank said nothing. \"you\\'re a hard case, frank.\" solange sighed, and nodded to the guards. frank watched the man shake up the bottle.',\n",
       " 'solange held up a hand and inclined his head toward annie. \"no,\" he said. \"her turn.\" blood rushed to frank\\'s head. \"leave her alone.\" \"ah... the gift of speech.\" solange came over to the table and opened the cookie tin. removing a small, translucent plastic bag, he shook it open. frank saw the word safeway. \"a secondary use of the bag,\" solange said. \"this is actually considered better than recycling.\" out of his fucking mind, frank thought, watching in horror as one of the guards picked up a small aerosol can. in a single choreographed moment, he sprayed it into annie\\'s face - as if he were spraying an insect -while solange pulled the plastic bag over her head, looping the handles around her neck and pulling them tight. frank surged to his feet, but was pulled down from behind and restrained in his chair while annie exploded from her torpor. but with her hands cuffed behind her, she had no way to remove the bag, which deflated and inflated horribly with each frantic sucking breath. she lurched, thrashing her head from one side to another, trying to get the bag off, biting at it, her face flushed with whatever it was that they\\'d sprayed. \"hello,\" solange said with a chuckle. \"pepper gas.\" how long this went on - the pepsi jetting into his sinus cavities, annie, the bags, the pepper spray frank could not have said - although at the end, both of the bottles stood on the table, empty. it could have been ten minutes; it could have been a couple of hours. pain, as it turned out, was a landscape with its own dimensions, where ordinary rules of duration didn\\'t apply. he \"talked,\" of course, and later wondered why it had taken him so long to do so. but it didn\\'t make any difference. there was always another question, and if solange was skeptical of an answer, the rag went back in his mouth and the pepsi shot through his nose. and then, when frank had given up hope that this would ever end, solange stopped it. \"they\\'ve had enough,\" he said sharply, as if to rebuke the others. he approached frank and gave his shoulder a squeeze. \"it\\'s over,\" he said. \"no more pain. that\\'s it. it\\'s over.\" frank knew he should have felt revulsion at solange\\'s touch, but instead he felt gratitude. he knew better. but that\\'s what he felt. \"bring them some clean clothes,\" solange ordered. \"and ask the doc to give them some xanax or something, just to take the edge off.\" and then he was gone. half an hour later they were escorted through the halls like two oddly subdued houseguests, to the mansion\\'s former ballroom, a large chamber with a gleaming wooden floor and barrel-vaulted ceiling. the room had been converted into a large office. the walls were arrayed with pie charts, maps, bar graphs, satellite photos. there were desks, computers, telephones, ranks of filing cabinets. the horse logo was on virtually everything. frank and annie, hands secured behind them, were led toward a desk where solange sat, working on a computer. he did not glance up at their approach. they stood and waited. above frank, on the corkboarded walls, were a series of false-color photographs of what seemed to be wheat fields, shot from above. in each case, a circle had been inscribed on the photograph, a wedge shape marked into the circle. in each case, the wheat seemed afflicted - either diseased or else suffering from drought. the',\n",
       " 'severity of the affliction varied, from a few speckles of brown on a healthy-looking crop to, in another case, a field of wheat that seemed to have collapsed into a dark smudge, as if it had melted. each bore a date and information scrawled in grease pencil in the photograph\\'s margin. frank looked at the notations. puccina graminus 272 - 4017-9 puccina graminus 181 - 2022-7 puccina graminus 101 - 1097-3 puccina graminus 56 - 6340-7 solange finished whatever he was working on and turned off his computer. he glanced up at frank and annie, and smiled warmly. \"ah. here you are. looking much better.\" \"what is puccina graminus?\" annie asked. her voice sounded odd to frank, somehow robotized. that was the effect of the tranquilizers; he assumed he would sound the same way. certainly he felt odd, not exactly tranquil, but weirdly disconnected, as if he were pretending to be himself. \"wheat-stem rust,\" solange said. he gestured at the photographs. \"those are some early field trials. we\\'re like horse breeders, looking to create the fastest and bestest puccina graminus. so far - fifty-six is our secretariat, but it\\'s early days yet. apart from the wheat rust, we\\'re also working with various corn blights and rice blast. those are the major food crops.\" annie frowned. she tossed a quick look at frank. despite her dead voice, despite the clear evidence of her ordeal, he was heartened by the lively awareness in her eyes. otherwise, she looked as if she\\'d been stranded on a life raft for several days. her skin was chapped and reddened, her lips blistered, her eyes limned in red. \"but why?\" she said. \"why are you doing this?\" \"to redress the balance,\" solange replied. \"to weigh in on mother nature\\'s behalf against a species which has tipped the balance against every other. you\\'re a scientist. you ought to understand. the \"green revolution,\" with its hybrid wheat and disease-resistant corn and rice, supports a population that\\'s laying waste to the planet. we don\\'t need it. and nature doesn\\'t want it.\" \"so,\" annie said, \"you create plague and famine.\" solange didn\\'t answer her. instead, he looked at his watch and sprang up. \"time to go,\" he said, and the whole strange parade - the shackled annie and frank, the silent and ever-present phalanx of guards, followed the ebullient solange toward the elevator. \"you mentioned famines and plagues?\" solange said. \"but why not? if one man can create a vaccine against influenza, and that\\'s natural, why is it unnatural for another to create a superflu? if we had time, i would love to show you why it\\'s necessary. i could show you the numbers, the projections, the damage that the earth will sustain. then you\\'d see that it is necessary to interfere with a species that is metastisizing out of control. you\\'d see, and you\\'d join us. and you\\'d be useful in the labs, i don\\'t doubt that - although,\" he frowned, \"i can\\'t really envision a role for frank. but -\" he clapped his hands together. \"- we don\\'t have that time.\" frank\\'s heart started beating faster when they got into an elevator and he saw one of the kids press 3b. it was the floor where they\\'d been tortured. indeed, they walked down the same corridor. annie\\'s footsteps picked up pace as they passed the room, and frank found himself holding his breath. but solange kept going past it. they went through two sets of green safety doors with wire mesh in the glass windows before solange turned and walked down a short corridor. one of the guards pulled a key ring out of his pocket, unlocked two separate dead bolts, and held open the heavy door. solange stepped in and they followed.',\n",
       " 'soon, they found themselves in a square room with cinder-block walls and a raked gravel floor - like a zen garden\\'s. there were two rattan chairs and, between them, a small rattan table, upon which stood a bud vase holding a single sprig of lilac. one entire wall of the room consisted of a set of white enameled doors, each of which bore a decal of the white horse against the big blue marble of the earth. \"sit down, please,\" solange said, gesturing at the chairs. they sat down. at a nod from solange, the guards unshouldered their weapons and aimed them at frank and annie. \"i apologize for the drama,\" solange said, \"but folks do get upset. we\\'ve learned to anticipate that.\" annie shot frank a terrified look, and both of them stared at the guns until solange noted their focus and rushed to reassure them. \"oh, don\\'t worry, we\\'ll give you a few hours to meditate, and cleanse your minds, before we put you in bertha here,\" he said, patting the enameled door as if it were the hide of a prized steer. \"she\\'s solved one of our most persistent people problems. i only wish we\\'d had her for the bergmans.\" he pulled open the doors. the room itself was so spotless and austere that frank was surprised to see that the interior of the refrigerator, or whatever it was, was quite dirty - streaked with soot and dirt, clumps of what appeared to be ashes on the floor. frank struggled to make sense of what solange had just said. what did he mean, \"for the bergmans\\'? \"it\\'s a microwave chamber,\" solange said. \"basically, it boils away the liquid, and then it\\'s a form of rapid dessication. you end up as a little pile of soot.\" he reached up behind him, rubbed his finger against the interior wall, and then showed them a dark and oily smudge. \"well, this is your friend ben stern.\" even though he felt the drug pressing him down in his seat, even though moving through the air was like moving through water, even with the guns pointed his way, frank surged to his feet and lunged toward solange. \"you psycho fuck,\" he said. solange ducked to the side and swung at him, hard. and again. his blows were powerful, and frank was helpless, his feet rooted, his hands shackled behind him. finally, he took a punch in the stomach, which doubled him over. the guards shoved him back into the chair. solange was laughing, a rolling chortle, laughing in genuine shoulder-shaking amusement. finally, he stopped and shook his head. \"i give him enough drugs to stop an ox and he comes at me.\" he sighed. \"very impressive.\" \"why are you doing this?\" annie asked. she spoke in the labored cadence of a stroke victim, each word emerging separately. solange looked nonplussed. \"i told you. it\\'s a disposal problem.\" \"no!\" annie said. \"i mean the spanish flu. wheat-stem rust.\" once again solange looked startled. \"because i am the first horseman. aren\\'t you paying attention?\" \"what are you talking about?\" frank demanded. solange looked at him. \"revelation.\" and then he began to speak, but in a different voice, a voice that was powerful and nuanced. a preacher\\'s voice. \"and i saw the lamb open one of the seals, and i heard the noise of thunder, and one of the four beasts saying, come and see.',\n",
       " 'and i saw and beheld a white horse: and he that sat upon him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering.\" the guards were starry-eyed. \"god sends me forth to conquer, to conquer, yes to conquer a species gone amok, spiraling out of control, a species destroying its earthly paradise.\" frank couldn\\'t help himself. he turned to the guards. \"you believe this shit?\" then he turned back to solange. \"you\\'re the craziest motherfucker i\\'ve ever heard in my life!\" and then he started laughing. he couldn\\'t help himself. he was so scared, it was either that or cry. solange stared at him, and for a moment frank thought he was going to kill him, there and then. but just as solange took a step toward him, a cell phone chirped in his pocket. it was such an unexpected, incongruous sound, it seemed to go straight to the middle of frank\\'s head. solange plucked the phone out of his pocket with an annoyed look. \"yes,\" he said impatiently. \"what is it?\" he listened, for perhaps an entire minute, and during that minute frank could sense solange losing interest in the room, in him, in annie. it was as if his awareness were palpable and its sudden absence made frank feel oddly abandoned. solange frowned, removed the phone from his ear, pushed down the antenna, and strode to the door without another glance at them. \"let\\'s go,\" he said. \"what about them?\" solange shrugged. \"let them think about it,\" he replied. frank heard the dead bolts shoot home, first one, then the other. because the floor was gravel, it took a long time to smash the bud vase, which was quite thick. when they finally succeeded, it was a relatively simple matter to cut themselves loose. but as they soon found out, there was no way out of the room - which was locked from the outside. there was nothing else they could do, really, except hold each other. frank told annie that when the door opened, he\\'d take out the first person who came through it. they\\'d have surprise on their side, and maybe he could grab the guy\\'s gun. or something. it wasn\\'t much, but in fact it was the only thing, the only thing they could do. then they slept, lying on the floor next to each other. annie dreamed of stern and whimpered in her sleep. frank dreamed of carlos. and he was still dreaming when he heard a noise like distant thunder, a series of concussive shocks that made the fluorescent light rattle and the door shudder. he thought at first that it was part of his dream. either that or he was starting to hallucinate. but annie heard it, too, and woke up and stared at him. they wondered if the pharmaceutical labs were exploding. and then the noise stopped, and soon they were dozing again. suddenly, an amplified voice exploded around them. \"stand clear of the door.\"',\n",
       " 'the men who came in were in flak jackets with fbi imprinted in huge letters on their backs. they wore helmets and gas masks and were heavily armed. they were not friendly, either, and did not understand that frank and annie were victims, not temple followers hiding out in some inner sanctum. it took quite a long time, really, to make that point. nor was neal gleason, when they were finally face-to-face with him, happy to see them, or even pleased that they\\'d survived. gleason\\'s blue eyes were bloodshot and he looked like a man who hadn\\'t slept in several days. \"i guess you got the message,\" frank said. \"somebody tipped them,\" gleason said. \"they must have someone in the lake placid p.d. because they were the only ones who knew about the raid.\" \"who got away?\" frank asked. \"solange,\" gleason said. \"solange and his special affairs team.\"',\n",
       " 'chapter 29 he sat in the great room of the headmaster\\'s house, watching over annie as she slept through the sleeping pills she\\'d been given. he wanted to work on the story, of course, but writing was impossible. he wasn\\'t victor hugo. he needed a computer, or at least a typewriter. even a telephone. he could dictate the story. but the phone in the great room was dead, and the one in the hall was off-limits. an atf agent sat outside the great room with a wire in his ear and an uzi in his lap, making sure no one came or went without neal gleason\\'s approval. it took a while, but frank finally got an explanation - of sorts. \"i\\'m supposed to protect you,\" the agent said in a peeved tone. \"okay?\" \"no,\" frank told him. \"it\\'s not okay. i don\\'t want protection. i want a fucking thinkpad.\" but that, of course, was precisely the point. gleason didn\\'t want him to write a story - not, at least, while solange was on the loose. so he was left to browse, to pace, and to stand at the windows, watching the scene outside. which was strangely sinister, a surreal tableau that, if painted by bosch, might have been called, \"eden invaded.\" a helicopter sat in the meadow next to the pond, its rotors turning slowly, while german shepherds towed atf gunmen up one path and down another. marines in biohazard suits wandered in and out of the labs, looking like advertisements for intel, while fbi agents in matching windbreakers piled computers and filing cabinets into the back of a large white van. otherwise, the campus seemed deserted, with the templars confined to dormitories, waiting to be questioned. eventually, frank tired of the view and sat down at an elaborately carved desk in an alcove off the great room. its four clawed feet rested on a vintage kilim beneath a portrait of edward abbey. a nineteeninch toshiba monitor sat on the desk\\'s surface with its cables dangling toward the floor.',\n",
       " 'there was no cpu. it would have been nice to have gotten a look at solange\\'s hard disk, frank thought. but maybe there was something else... a notepad, a floppy, a calendar - anything. one by one he opened the drawers of the desk and looked inside. but there was nothing. a couple of pens, some pencils and paper clips, an empty notebook, and a ream of iroquois laser bond. a map of new york city, a pair of scissors, some thumbtacks, and empty note cards. he unfolded the map and looked at it. nothing, he thought. no marks or pinpricks. no hand-drawn lines. it\\'s just a map. with a sigh, he leaned back in the chair and closed his eyes. he sat that way for a long while, and then, suddenly energized or just impatient, he sat up straight. sweeping the map from the desk, he took out a piece of paper and began to write. who says i\\'m not victor hugo? he passed about fifteen minutes in this way, and then looked over what he\\'d written - half a dozen variations on the same lead paragraph. okay, so i\\'m not victor hugo, frank thought. i\\'m the writer in the shining, the one jack nicholson played. crumpling the pages into a ball, he tossed them into the wastebasket. solange\\'s wastebasket. which was half full. was the fbi really so sloppy? could they have possibly overlooked the wastebasket? apparently. getting to his feet, he dumped the contents of the basket on the desk and began to sort through it. there wasn\\'t much. a laser-printed copy of last week\\'s morbidity and mortality weekly report. the first two pages of an essay entitled \"the politics of dystopia.\" crumpled post-its with messages like \"call nikki,\" \"tues. intvw. w-futurist,\" and \"query belinda @ recruitment tables.\" there was an empty bottle of evian water, a crumpled box of lakrits mentholated lozenges, and fragments of what turned out to be a four-by-five, black-and-white snapshot. the picture had been torn in half three times. reassembled on the desk, the eight pieces combined to form a photo of a little house. or not quite a house -a construction shack. or something like a construction shack. whatever it was, it sat in the middle of an industrial urban nowhere, as anonymous as a slab of cement. its blasted surroundings might have belonged to parts of yonkers or anacostia, east l.a. or south-side chicago. hard to tell. harder still to guess what it meant to solange (if, indeed, it meant anything). he was still puzzling over the picture when an fbi agent came through the door with a bag full of chicken salad sandwiches and cans of mountain dew. \"if i could just get a statement from you and your friend,\" he said, \"we might be able to move things along.\" \"you mean, we could leave?\" \"that\\'s up to neal,\" the fbi agent said, \"but until we get your statement, i don\\'t think anything\\'s going to change real quick.\" and so he woke up annie - it was mid-afternoon, after all - and when she was ready, they told the bureau\\'s man what they knew. or most of what they knew. when frank mentioned the chosen soren organization, the agent suddenly stopped taking notes. with a sigh, he recapped his pen and got to his',\n",

       " 'wasserman looked genuinely puzzled. \"why do you say that?\" she asked. \"because he\\'s a \"kook.\" they\\'re all kooks. so no matter what happens, no matter what they say or do, it happens out of context. it has no context. once you say a \"cult\" did it, you strip the event of any political significance it might ever have.\" \"why?\" \"because a cult is basically a convention of lone nuts,\" frank replied. \"i mean, that\\'s what people think. and because they\\'re nuts, what they do isn\\'t seen as rational. so their actions don\\'t have any coherent meaning. which is just another way of saying they\\'re beyond investigation. \"deniable.\"\" wasserman nodded, thinking about it. \"let\\'s say you\\'re right. why do you think north korea would want to jumpstart an epidemic that might kill half the people in the country?\" \"because if that many people died, the country would fall apart. our highest priority - our only priority - would be to bury the dead. or burn them. and even if we still had a government that worked, i don\\'t see it sending people off to fight a foreign war. i think we\\'d stay right where we are. cut wood, and build crematoriums.\" wasserman was silent for a while. then she asked, \"you mentioned \"a foreign war.\"\" \"i was thinking about north korea invading the south.\" \"and is this something you intend to write about?\" frank rubbed the stubble on his jaw. \"i don\\'t know,\" he said. \"maybe.\" wasserman nodded. \"or maybe not. you can\\'t prove it.\" \"right,\" frank said.’ican\\'t prove it.\" \"and it really doesn\\'t matter, anyway,\" wasserman added, getting to her feet. annie looked shocked. \"it doesn\\'t matter? how can you say that?\" \"because mr. daly\\'s right. solange is deniable. and look at the possibilities. if solange succeeds, the question of responsibility is moot. half the people in the country will be dead, and you\\'re right - i\\'m not at all sure that, under the circumstances, we would have a government interested in foreign affairs.\" \"okay. and what if he fails?\" frank asked. \"well, then he\\'s just a nut. even if you could trace the money that he was given - and i don\\'t think you could - what would it show? that it came from north korea? i don\\'t think so. the most you\\'d be able to prove is that it came from korean workers living in japan. to which a lot of people would say, so what? maybe solange has a lot of korean followers. maybe they\\'re crazy, too.\" \"and the point is, what?\" frank asked. wasserman shrugged. \"only that you should be careful. in the end, what\\'s really at stake is frank daly\\'s credibility. and let\\'s face it, i don\\'t think you want to look like a conspiracy theorist - even if you\\'re right. now, do you?\" before he could answer, she turned on her heel and left.',\n",

       " 'frank looked skeptical. \"fema\\'s given us all the powers we need,\" gleason said. \"fema?\" annie said. \"the federal emergency management agency,\" frank replied. \"we\\'ve shut down the new york and washington air corridors to small planes. same thing with the rivers. you won\\'t see any motorboats on the hudson or east rivers - or the potomac, either. not until this is over, and maybe never again.\" \"what about the big ships?\" annie asked, nodding toward the queue of freighters. \"they don\\'t get in the harbor until they\\'ve been searched and we\\'ve put a team on board.\" \"and the subways?\" frank asked. \"we\\'ve got people on every train.\" \"what about a car?\" annie asked. \"or a truck. if they\\'ve micro-encapsulated the virus, it could pass through the catalytic converter and right out the exhaust. all they\\'d have to do is drive around. no one would notice a thing.\" gleason thought about it. \"jesus,\" frank said, looking at annie. \"you could be dangerous.\" \"i don\\'t think so,\" gleason decided. \"you wouldn\\'t get the kind of penetration that you want. not with a car. you\\'d need a boat or a plane. something that goes all over the place. a subway system would be good.\" \"and the water supply?\" frank asked. gleason shook his head. \"no. it\\'s a myth about dumping something into the water supply. you wouldn\\'t get the kind of dispersion that you\\'d need. and i\\'m told that you might not be infected anyway, if you drank it. it\\'s a respiratory virus.\" \"what i don\\'t understand,\" frank said, \"is why you think you can handle this without anyone noticing. i mean, just the pilots -\" \"oh, they\\'ll notice, all right. people will notice. but you won\\'t see anything about it in the press.\" \"why not?\" \"because every media outlet in the country got a fax or a phone call this morning.\" \"so now we have censorship?\" gleason made a moue. \"no more than we had during desert storm. anyway, it\\'s just this, and it\\'s only temporary,\" he said. \"you can still read the box scores.\" seeing frank\\'s frown, the fbi agent elaborated. \"look, it\\'s the twentieth century. which is another way of saying we\\'re living in a crowded theater. people start running around, yelling \"fire\" -\"',\n",
       " '\"what if there is a fire?\" frank asked. \"we\\'ll handle it,\" gleason replied. \"okay,\" frank said. \"so handle it. what do you need us for? i mean, if i can\\'t publish the story -\" \"it\\'s not that simple,\" gleason said. \"why not?\" \"because of the internet,\" annie suggested, her voice disconsolate. gleason inclined his head in a way that was half nod, half bow. \"it\\'s a big problem,\" he said. frank watched a seagull turn in a gyre above the gun on the bow. \"so what\\'s next?\" he asked. \"how long do we sit here?\" gleason shrugged. \"that\\'s up to solange,\" he said.',\n",
       " 'chapter 30 staten island susannah wasn\\'t used to driving trucks, but the u-haul was really easy. it had an automatic shift, and terrific visibility. which was good, because ever since the boxing match, she was having trouble with her eyes. behind the heart-shaped sunglasses she wore, her right eye was almost completely closed, and her left was filled with blood and kind of blurry. the doctor said it would be all right, but not right away. it would probably take a while. meanwhile, stephen sat in his car seat, gurgling. talk about the \"butterflies.\" she was scared. not so much by what they were about to do, and what might happen if it went wrong - but of getting it wrong. she had special instructions from solange, and god help her if she fucked up... she\\'d gotten to the dock almost an hour before, arriving about a minute after the ferry left. this looked like bad luck, but it was actually intentional. first on, first off, solange had said, like it was important. so she\\'d sat there for fifty-nine minutes, and then, when the gate lifted, she drove slowly forward until the truck was deep inside the ferry. in the rearview mirror she could see the frenchman\\'s car, with vaughn and belinda in the backseat. she was really nervous. but she shouldn\\'t have been. in most ways, her job was the easiest. in fact, she didn\\'t really have anything to do unless they got into trouble. which is where you come in, cher, you\\'re plan b. cool, she thought. i\\'m plan b. no one else is plan-anything, except, i guess, for plan a. that\\'s what they are. but i\\'m plan b. she squinched her eyes together because they were tearing up, which they\\'d been doing a lot lately. outside, she could hear the ferrymen shouting to one another, and the boat\\'s horn - a deep, howling tooooot. then the floor began to tremble, and the walls, too, and suddenly they were rumbling ahead. smoother now, gathering speed. lots of speed. she could feel it.',\n",
       " 'as if on cue, vaughn and belinda climbed out of the car behind, then went around to its trunk, where the ingrams were stashed. they were wearing the matching t-shirts solange had designed - so everyone could recognize each other, right off, no matter how confusing it got. the t-shirts were cool bloodred, with a mudman\\'s head on the front, and above it: the meek she wished she had one... but not really. because this way it was even better. she was special. she was plan b. ordinarily, she might have felt left out, but this time, she didn\\'t. because solange wasn\\'t wearing a t-shirt either. so he was plan b, too. behind her, the door to the u-haul shrieked as someone, probably saul, rolled it up into the roof. then the truck rocked and, a moment later, she could hear them dragging out the aerosolizer. she eased herself out of the truck and went around to the other side. opening the door, she unhooked stephen from his car seat, boosted him up to her shoulder, and headed for the deck. \"rotsa ruck,\" she said, walking past a grinning solange. and then she was outside, and it was kind of glorious, the air fresh and damp and breezy. there were lots of people on deck, mostly smiling, and inside, too. \"look at that,\" she said to stephen, pointing, \"that\\'s a big city! can you see the big city? where is the big city? oh! there it is!\" an old black man with a shoe-shine kit gave her a smile, then turned to a guy who looked like a banker and, nodding at his wing tips, said, \"you need help, my man! you kinda scruffy!\" a blues band started to play in the main salon. someone threw a nerf ball to someone else. kids ran shouting up and down the deck. she was standing at the railing, showing stephen the statue of liberty, when she heard a soft burst of submachine-gun fire from somewhere in the middle of the boat. a woman screamed as a second gun came into play, and people started running this way and that, as if there was somewhere to go. then the screaming stopped and the ferry slowed almost to a halt, and her friends appeared out of nowhere, looking so cool you couldn\\'t believe it. saul and the frenchman, vaughn and belinda, veroushka and avram. maybe four or five others - all of them carrying ingrams. except saul, who was lugging the aerosolizer to the bow, and the frenchman, who carried an electric drill. \"everybody inside,\" veroushka ordered. \"let\\'s go!\" antonio shouted, pointing his ingram at a fat woman and her family. \"move it!\" jane yelled. \"are you stupid?\" one by one, and then by twos and threes and tens, the passengers surged into the main salon. it was neat being in charge, susannah thought. neat to be part of something that everyone else was afraid of. she laughed as the frenchman went past her and, turning, fired the battery-operated drill at her, pretending it was an ingram, then looked wide-eyed and shocked when the drill went whir whir instead of brrrt-brtt. talk about funny... and then, just for a second, while saul and the frenchman anchored the aerosolizer to the deck, things',\n",
       " 'got wobbly. this kid with a buzz cut grabbed jane by the hair, jerked her back and threw her to the ground - all in one motion, coming up fast and cold with the gun in his hand. jesus, susannah thought, this guy knows what he\\'s doing. but then, as it turned out, he didn\\'t. veroushka threw her gun to the ground and her hands in the air -\\'don\\'t shoot!\" she screamed. which made the guy turn, and just as he did, antonio came out of the main salon, firing his ingram in a left to right sweep that almost cut the kid\\'s head off. he stood there for what seemed like a long time, with his hands at his side and his head on his chest, swaying, while a woman a few feet away slid to the deck with a hole in her throat. then veroushka gave the guy a little push and he fell like a tree. people were screaming and crying as veroushka blew a kiss to antonio and picked up her gun. \"shut the fuck up!\" she yelled, as if she were trying to watch television. and the amazing thing was, they did. they shut the fuck up. solange was on the deck above, watching it all with a little smile, totally in control. susannah sidestepped a rivulet of blood and pulled stephen closer to her. \"yuck-a-puck!\" she whispered, feeling the stickiness on the soles of her shoes. \"look at that,\" annie said, pointing. frank squinted. \"what?\" \"the ferry. it\\'s stopped.\" frank stared. \"you\\'re right,\" he said, then changed his mind. \"no, it\\'s not. it\\'s moving again.\" he lifted a pair of binoculars to his eyes and trained them on the boat. for a moment he was puzzled. you\\'d think there\\'d be a lot of people outside, but there were only a dozen or so on deck. he turned the focal ring on the binoculars, trying to get a better look, but it was too far away to see much. all he could do was make out shapes and colors. red, mostly. \"do they wear uniforms on the ferry?\" he asked. \"who?\" \"the people who work on the ferry?\" \"i don\\'t think so,\" she said. \"because -\" suddenly, gleason came running up the stairs with the ship\\'s commander, a young lieutenant named horvath. \"we\\'ve got a problem,\" gleason said. \"with what?\" frank asked. \"the ferry,\" horvath replied, picking up a phone and shouting orders to the crew. somewhere below them, a bell began to ring, and a horn sounded three quick blasts. \"what\\'s the matter with it?\" annie asked, as the ship\\'s engines began to turn and sailors cast off from the dock. \"what\\'s happening?\"',\n",
       " '\"they\\'ve hijacked it.\" annie stared at him. \"you can\\'t let them go up the hudson,\" she said. \"i mean, you absolutely can\\'t.\" the chinquateague slipped away from the dock, turned, and began to gather speed, heading into the upper bay. frank leaned on the bridge\\'s console, steadying the binoculars. \"they\\'ve got a gun or something on the bow,\" he said. \"like a water cannon.\" \"it\\'s the aerosolizer,\" gleason said, dialing a number on his cell phone. turning away, he spoke urgently into the phone, saying, now, right now, then flipped it closed and put it away. \"how do you stop it?\" frank asked as the coast guard cutter pounded over the waves. \"if i have to,\" gleason said, \"i\\'ll sink them. \"you can\\'t sink them,\" annie said. \"there\\'s a couple of hundred people on the boat!\" the fbi agent ignored her and turned to the coast guard lieutenant. \"i\\'ll have a combat helicopter here in twenty minutes. can you stop them?\" the lieutenant looked unsure. \"i don\\'t know,\" he said. \"i guess i could ram them, if i had to, but... i\\'ll tell you what i can do: i can keep them away from the aerosolizer. i can make sure they don\\'t have a chance to use it.\" \"do it!\" gleason said, and got on the phone as the lieutenant ordered the cover removed from the 25mm gun. saul was the one who really caught it, susannah thought. he was getting the aerosolizer primed when the coast guard ship did a sort of brodie in the water, maybe a hundred yards away. then the fed started talking to them through the bullhorn, acting like he was their father, all reasonable and calm until vaughn and veroushka came to the railing and emptied their clips in his face. god, that was cool, susannah thought, the way the glass exploded on the bridge, with the megaphone going urrrrrrp and the feds or marines or whatever they were diving every which way. except it wasn\\'t so cool, because that\\'s when saul caught it, really caught it - and it wasn\\'t like he was doing anything. he was just standing there next to the aerosolizer, watching the show, and the cops opened up with this cannon or whatever it was, and jesus, they just about sawed him in half. i mean, really! and the other kid, too, the kid who was with him - except he wasn\\'t dead, just bleeding. and now the ferry was stopped, so it rolled a lot, and the passengers were getting seasick, sitting on the floor of the main salon, all quiet and pukey. why were they scared? susannah wondered. all the pressure was on her and her friends. if you looked outside, there were a couple of police boats, two fireboats, and a coast guard cutter. and that wasn\\'t all. they had a matte-black helicopter dead ahead, swaying like a dragonfly, its gun sights pointed right at the bow. she wondered how long it could sit there like that, just hanging in the air, before it ran out of fuel and dropped to the water. not that it would matter: they probably had frogmen, too. she was standing on the bridge with veroushka and solange, listening to the frenchman. he was pacing back and forth with a cell phone clapped to his cheek, arguing with the guy from the fbi, the negotiator.',\n",
       " '\"listen,\" gleason said, talking into the phone. \"what you\\'ve got to understand is, that boat is not going up the hudson. i\\'ll sink it before i let that happen. in fact, maybe you noticed the helicopter. that\\'s what it\\'s for. now, once you understand that, everything else is negotiable. so talk to me.\" the fbi agent paced as he listened, his eyes on annie and frank. \"i\\'m glad you brought that up,\" gleason said. \"and i\\'ll tell ya what i can do. you don\\'t need that many hostages. you don\\'t even want them. they\\'re a logistical problem.\" he listened for a moment, then cut back in. \"so we can make a deal. you let the women and children go, i\\'ll see you get some food - how\\'s that? pizzas. whatever!\" gleason listened for a moment, then flipped the cell phone closed. \"what did he say?\" annie asked. \"he\\'s thinking about it.\" \"let\\'s go, cher.\" susannah hesitated. \"stephen, too?\" she asked. \"absolutely, stephen,\" solange said. \"would i leave stephen? do i look crazy?\" then he picked up the book bag, the one with the virus ampoules, and slung it over his shoulder. \"etienne,\" he said, turning to the frenchman, \"when you talk to him - be a pain in the ass, eh? don\\'t make it too easy, or he\\'ll be suspicious. and tell him! only an ambulance on the dock. insist on it. nothing else.\" the frenchman - she\\'d never known his name -nodded. \"eh, bien, but... what if they won\\'t let us dock?\" he asked, pronouncing the last word duck. solange scoffed. \"he wants you to dock. it\\'s more dangerous for you there. so negotiate with him. tell him you\\'ll trade the aerosolizer for a plane to cuba. you give him that, and he\\'ll give you anything you want.\" \"and afterward?\" solange shrugged. \"you\\'ve been vaccinated. go to cuba.\" the frenchman looked doubtful. \"don\\'t you get it?\" solange laughed, slapping the words on the frenchman\\'s t-shirt. \"you\\'ve inherited the earth, you idiot! it\\'s yours, man!\" \"no hard feelings,\" gleason said as frank and annie got into the motor launch. \"i did what i had to do.\" \"you really think this is over?\" frank asked. gleason gestured to the ferry, which was tying up at the dock. \"yeah. except for the shouting, i do. i think it\\'s over. otherwise, you wouldn\\'t be going ashore.\" \"right,\" frank said, trying not to look too skeptical. \"we\\'re trading pizzas for people,\" gleason insisted. \"i\\'ll take that deal every time.\" \"who wouldn\\'t?\" annie asked. \"you watch: ten minutes from now, there\\'s going to be a lot of women and kids coming off that boat.',\n",
       " 'and after that? we\\'re gonna deal for the aerosolizer. so, yeah, i can hear the fat lady, loud and clear.\" you are the fat lady, frank thought, then waved as the motor launch turned and nosed through the water toward shore. annie looked at him. \"this is too easy,\" she said. \"i know.\" \"so... what do you think they\\'ll try to do? spray from the dock?\" frank shook his head. \"gleason won\\'t let him get near the aerosolizer. he\\'ll cut him in half.\" \"then... what?\" \"i don\\'t know. something.\" lights were winking on in the financial district. in the east, the brooklyn bridge stretched across the river like a monochrome rainbow. on gleason\\'s orders, the motor launch left them at a pier near the old slip, about a block behind the police line that began at the corner of south and broad streets. \"where do you want to go?\" annie asked. \"nowhere. i just want to watch the ferry.\" susannah made sure that stephen was safely in his car seat, then put the u-haul into gear and rolled forward. first on, first off, she thought, understanding for the first time why it was so important that the u-haul should be the first vehicle on the ferry. solange had thought of everything. as the truck trundled off the ferry and into the street, she could see the other women and children streaming onto the dock. the area around the terminal was deserted, except for a paramedic who stood next to an ambulance, directing everyone to a first-aid tent in nearby battery park. susannah turned onto state street, saw the roadblock up ahead, and swung right on water. the street was empty, but she could see the lights of police cars on the next block, and she instinctively avoided them. turning left onto whitehall, she found herself with nowhere to go. up ahead, a trio of squad cars sat in the intersection, blue lights whirling. on the sidewalks behind them, a crowd jostled with a television crew to get a glimpse of the ferry. susannah slowed. stopped. rolled down her window as a cop came up to her. \"you okay?\" he asked. \"uh-huh.\" the cop looked in the window at little stephen. \"how\\'s the little guy?\" \"oh, he\\'s fine,\" susannah said. \"we just want to get home. it\\'s been scary.\" she rubbed stephen\\'s hair. \"and it\\'s been a long day, y\\'know - moving and all.\" \"can i see some id?\" \"sure,\" susannah replied, fumbling in her handbag until she found her wallet. taking out her driver\\'s license, she handed it to the cop. he glanced at it and returned it. \"you mind if i look in the back?\" he asked.',\n",
       " 'susannah shook her head. \"whatever,\" she said. she watched him in the rearview mirror as he walked along the side of the truck. reaching the back, he disappeared from view and, a moment later, she heard the shriek of the aluminum door as the cop shoved it up into the roof. there were a dozen other cops in the intersection, and all of them looked tense. but then they relaxed as the door came clattering back down again. the cop returned. \"we didn\\'t know there were any vehicles coming off the ferry,\" he said. susannah made a helpless gesture. \"they said i could leave. so i got in the truck. was that wrong?\" the cop chuckled. \"no. it wasn\\'t wrong. it was just a surprise.\" then he looked concerned. \"is your husband on the ferry?\" susannah shook her head. \"no. i\\'m supposed to meet him at the truck place.\" \"well, they\\'re gonna want to debrief you. so, what i want you to do is this: hang a left on bridge street, right up there, and follow it over to the park. there\\'s a first-aid tent behind the memorial - you can\\'t miss it. tell the officer why you\\'re there - tell him you came off the ferry. otherwise, you\\'ll get a ticket.\" susannah nodded, quick little jerks of her head. her heart was beating against her chest like a woodpecker on a dead tree. frank and annie were standing behind the police line at whitehall and pearl, looking toward the ferry, when the u-haul drove up. they watched the cop as he talked to the driver, then walked around to the back of the truck and looked inside. annie\\'s hand tightened on frank\\'s arm. \"what?\" he asked, sounding distracted. \"it\\'s like the one i was in,\" she said. frank didn\\'t know what she meant at first, and then he understood. she was talking about the truck they\\'d used to kidnap her. \"well,\" he said \"it\\'s the same size, anyway.\" he wanted to get a look at the driver, who was talking to the cop again. \"that\\'s not what i mean,\" annie insisted. \"i mean it\\'s really like the one i was in.\" he heard the urgency in her voice, and turned to her. \"what do you mean?\" \"it\\'s got that southwestern motif - just like the other one.\" frank glanced at the u-haul, which the cop was beginning to wave through the intersection. he wanted to see the driver\\'s face, but he was on the wrong side of the street for that. but annie was right about the \"motif\\'. a flamenco dancer, or something like that, was painted on the side of the truck. she held a fan in front of her face, and the way her eyes were, you could tell that she was laughing. then the truck was past him, and he saw that it had new york plates - which, when you thought about it, didn\\'t make sense, not when you saw the logo. if the truck was from new york, it should have had skyscrapers on it. or a giant apple, or something. but not a senorita. instinctively, he started walking',\n",
       " 'after the truck, then jogging, pulling annie along behind him. the u-haul was signaling left, but it didn\\'t turn. when it got to bridge street, it accelerated and kept on going. \"putz!\" the cop yelled, throwing his hands in the air. and that\\'s when it hit frank. he didn\\'t know why, but suddenly he got the joke and knew that he had to catch the truck. \"it\\'s the spanish lady,\" he said. \"it\\'s a senorita, but -\" \"i get it,\" annie shot back, hurrying to keep up with him. when they reached the next corner, frank glanced left and right, looking for a car or a cab, then spotted a black limo waiting outside a restaurant on stone street. the chauffeur was sitting on the front fender, reading a newspaper. frank walked past the car and, seeing the keys in the ignition, told annie to get in the passenger\\'s seat and lock the door. \"but -\" \"just do it,\" he said, and watched as she complied, her reluctance almost palpable. the door slammed shut. \"hey!\" the chauffeur exclaimed, surprised to hear the car door slam. \"hey, lady! whattaya doin\\'? this ain\\'t your car!\" irritated, he slid off the fender and came around to the passenger\\'s side, just as annie locked the door. \"get outta there!\" he ordered, knocking on the window. \"you can\\'t be in there!\" \"sorry about that,\" frank said, going around to the driver\\'s side and pulling open the door. \"let me talk to her.\" then he climbed in, pulled the door shut behind him, and turned the key in the ignition. the limo started with a roar. the chauffeur yelled \"muh-thuh-fuhhh?!\" and the car leapt from the curb. in his rearview mirror frank could see the chauffeur running down the street, screaming for the police. and then they turned a corner and he was gone. the whole thing had taken less than a minute, but even so, it was sheer luck that they caught sight of the u-haul - and that it was the right u-haul. maybe the driver had gotten lost in the maze of streets around the world trade center, or maybe she was just slow. but after a minute or so they spotted it about a block ahead of them, rumbling down fulton toward the fdr. the lights were all wrong, turning red just as frank hit the intersections, but it didn\\'t matter. he\\'d have welcomed a police car\\'s lights but, naturally, there wasn\\'t a cop in sight. there was, however, a car phone, and frank told annie to call gleason. \"how?\" she asked. \"i don\\'t know his number.\" \"just call him,\" he said. \"call the fbi\\'s washington field office. tell them it\\'s an emergency. tell them it\\'s about solange. that\\'ll get their attention. do the same with fema and the coast guard. one of them will put you through.\" \"but how do i get their numbers?\" she asked. frank groaned. \"five-five-five, one-two -\" \"but how will they call us back? we\\'re in a stolen car.\"',\n",
       " 'he took a deep breath, exhaled, and said, \"you don\\'t like making phone calls, do you?\" ‘i mean it!\" annie said defensively. \"how do i tell them to get back to us?\" \"it\\'s the fbi,\" frank replied. \"they probably have caller id. in fact, they could probably sequence your dna over the phone, if you hung on long enough.\" with a deep, mistrustful frown, she picked up the phone and began dialing, regarding the instrument as if it were a snake. meanwhile, frank drove, or tried to. he kept the u-haul in sight beneath the elevated highway, then followed it up the ramp, with numerous cars now between them. traffic on the fdr was bumper-tobumper, surging from fifteen to twenty-five miles per hour and back again. even so, he could see the u-haul, maybe a hundred yards ahead. \"where is it going?\" annie asked, putting her hand over the receiver. frank shook his head. \"uptown...\" he replied, leaning forward to turn on the radio. he found a news station right away, but there was nothing about the staten island ferry, the temple, or anything else. they passed the williamsburg bridge. \"that\\'s gleason,\" frank remarked, gesturing at the radio. \"gleason and fema. if it was up to them, you\\'d need a q-clearance to get a weather report.\" the lower east side rolled by, and then the midtown tunnel. when they came abreast of the u.n., frank thought he had a chance to close the gap, but a motorcyclist cut him off, and that was that. soon they were on the upper east side, and the u-haul\\'s turn signal began to blink. at ninety-sixth street it exited the highway, and so did frank and annie. but once again the lights betrayed them. the u-haul rumbled through an intersection on yellow, but there wasn\\'t any way frank and annie could make it. a wall of traffic surged across their path and \"goddammit!\" frank cried out, slamming his palm against the steering wheel and falling back against the seat. when the light finally changed - and it seemed to frank as if it took an hour - he floored the limo without a thought as to where he would go. a block later he turned right and began driving toward harlem. \"why harlem?\" annie asked. \"why not?\" frank replied, looking left and right, hoping to see the u-haul. three or four minutes passed that way, and then, with a triumphal look, annie handed him the telephone. \"i got him,\" she said. \"gleason?\" frank asked. \"this better be important,\" the fbi agent replied. \"we\\'re kinda busy here!\" \"i think someone got off the ferry who wasn\\'t supposed to.\" there was a silence on the other end of the line, and then: \"what do you mean?\"',\n",
       " 'frank told him about the u-haul. \"and you\\'re following it?\" gleason asked. \"where are you?\" \"i lost it in harlem,\" frank said. \"but it\\'s somewhere around here. or it was. anyway, i\\'m at 122nd and... what? third avenue.\" \"i\\'ll get the nypd to help.\" \"what i\\'m worried about is whether or not there\\'s virus on the truck.\" \"i know.\" \"what do you mean, you know?\" \"we ran a voiceprint on the guy i\\'m negotiating with.\" \"and?\" \"it\\'s not solange.\" frank blinked. \"what? then who is it?\" he asked. \"what\\'s the difference, who it is? it\\'s some frog! or rich little. or - who cares who it is? the point is, it ain\\'t solange.\" \"give me your number,\" frank said. \"in case we find the truck.\" gleason did, and they hung up. \"solange is loose,\" he said. \"they\\'ve been \"negotiating\" with the wrong guy.\" annie rolled her eyes in despair. five minutes later they saw it. the truck was parked near the corner of madison avenue and 132nd street, just off the fdr. frank pulled up behind it and stopped. he told annie to call gleason and tell him where they found the truck. then he got out of the car and, cautiously, walked around to the front of the u-haul. the woman was sitting behind the wheel, nursing her baby. he recognized her right away. it was the same bitch-madonna who\\'d jangled his chakras two weeks before, smearing the steering wheel of his car with the shit that sent him through the looking glass. \"how sweet,\" he said, yanking the door open, reaching in to take the keys. \"you\\'re too late,\" she replied, her eyes on the baby, uninterested in frank. \"where\\'d he go?\" \"fuck you.\" he almost pulled her out of the truck, but his sense of priorities got the better of him, and he slammed the door instead. then he walked around to the back, where annie was waiting. \"the cops are on their way,\" she said. frank nodded, then grabbed the handle of the truck\\'s rear door and, yanking it upward, sent it clattering into the roof. looking inside, he found what he\\'d expected: a false wall, about two feet deep, between',\n",
       " 'the truck\\'s cab and the cargo area. a part of the wall gaped open, just as solange had left it. \"that\\'s where he was when they came off the ferry,\" frank said. \"who\\'s the driver?\" annie asked. \"remember the bitch who said i left my lights on?\" \"really!?\" frank nodded. \"she\\'s feeding junior.\" \"but... where\\'s solange? what\\'s he going to do?\" \"the same thing he tried to do on the ferry.\" \"but how? how can he?\" \"i don\\'t know,\" frank said, shaking his head and looking around. they were in the midst of a blasted urban landscape. there was a burnt-out building. a few high-rise buildings and some redbrick projects, filigreed with graffiti. some tenements. a vacant lot. every hundred feet or so a column of steam rose from the street, swirling out of the manholes. steam. frank turned back to annie. \"where was it the students got sick?\" \"what students?\" \"when they ran the dispersion tests.\" she tried to remember. \"madison. the university of wisconsin. why?\" \"because we never figured out the methods they were using.\" \"well, they definitely used a boat, somewhere. and a plane.\" frank shook his head. \"but in madison - how come only students got sick?\" \"it wasn\\'t just students, really,\" annie said, correcting him. \"teachers got sick, too.\" \"but it was pretty much confined to campus. right?\" annie nodded. \"so how come?\" \"i don\\'t know,\" annie said. \"well, i think i do,\" frank mused. \"it was because of the method they used.\" \"and what method was that?\" annie asked. frank nodded at the fog rising from a nearby manhole. \"steam?\" she asked.',\n",
       " '\"count on it,\" frank replied. \"hospitals and universities use it. they use it to heat, but also for airconditioning. cities, too. half the buildings in this city are heated by steam. maybe more.\" \"but... it\\'s a closed system,\" annie said. \"the steam doesn\\'t get into the building\\'s ventilation system. it just heats the radiators -\" \"it\\'s vented everywhere,\" frank insisted. \"not in the buildings, but on the way to the buildings. it\\'s vented through traps on every street corner in the city. look around you.\" she did. little wisps of steam were everywhere. finally, she asked, \"where\\'d you learn about this?\" \"my father worked in a generating plant,\" frank told her. \"in kerwick. i helped him a couple of summers.\" \"but...\" annie looked confused. \"how can solange get the virus into the pipes?\" \"if he gets into the plant, there\\'s a place where they add chemicals - polishers and demineralizers. it goes right into the system.\" \"but aren\\'t the plants guarded?\" frank nodded. \"yeah,\" he said, \"they\\'re guarded.\" suddenly, he looked doubtful. \"it\\'s just a theory. and, anyway, i don\\'t see any generating plants in the neighborhood, do you?\" they looked around them. there was nothing like that. just slums. annie nodded toward the front of the truck. \"what does she say?\" she asked. \"\"fuck you,\\'\" he replied, then seeing the startled look on her face, added, \"i\\'m quoting. it wasn\\'t a suggestion.\" his eyes returned to the street, searching for solange. he knew he was nearby. he had to be. but there was nothing. some bodegas. a vacant lot, this one with a chain-link fence, and some kind of shack or blockhouse. a storefront church. the redbrick housing project, its grassy public areas worn down to hardpan dirt. kids jumping rope. solange\\'s wastepaper basket. the shack was the same one whose picture he\\'d fished out of solange\\'s wastebasket. the picture he\\'d torn into pieces. \"he\\'s in there,\" frank said, pointing to the building. annie frowned. \"how do you know?\" she asked. frank shook off the question. \"just keep an eye on mother teresa,\" he replied, and broke into a run. . the shack was a cinder-block cube that rested on a carpet of glass in the center of a vacant lot, surrounded by a chain-link fence that was topped with razor wire. frank walked along the fence, looking for the opening he knew would be there. and, finding it, he slipped inside. he approached the shack as if he were walking through a mine field, expecting at any moment to be shot. but there was nothing. a broken lock lay on the ground, and the door was ajar. stepping inside, he found the shack empty. but now he knew where he was, and he knew what the shack was. it was a \"headhouse,\" an unheated',\n",
       " 'building that enclosed a vertical shaft, whose ladder carried utility crews into the city\\'s underground. this would be a spectacular, if unseen, maze of catacombs and tunnels, vaults and chimneys, sewers and watercourses, that gave access to utility lines of every kind -electric and gas, water and steam, cable and telephone. frank knew this because all steam systems were set up more or less the same way. also, one of the steamfitters in kerwick had previously worked for con ed in new york. just like the city it served, the system was famously huge and complex and the guy never shut up about it. he could almost hear the guy\\'s voice now. \"in new york the entrance to the shaft was under a metal plate in the floor. frank lifted the plate, recoiling from the sewery smell that welled up at him, sat down and put his feet into the shaft. and then, with all the care that fear could muster, he began his descent, hating every rung. for him, it was the worst of possible worlds - a fusion of vertigo and claustrophobia. the shaft was barely as wide as his shoulders, dimly lit and evil-smelling. he had no way of knowing how far it descended - whether thirty feet or a hundred - but it was a long way to fall, in any case. and the ladder was slick, slimy to his hands, greasy to his feet. twice he slipped. twice he hung on. and then he was on the ground, listening to his heart race as he stood at the end of a low, dank tunnel that reminded him - ludicrously - of an old horror movie. the thing. where the bad guy turns out to be a carrot. pay attention, he told himself. you don\\'t want to get killed in here. you don\\'t even want to get lost in here. slowly, he began to move forward. and then, as his eyes adjusted to the twilight around him, his pace quickened, a rush of urgency overtaking his fear. he had to get solange before solange got to the plant. fortunately, he didn\\'t have to decide which way to go. the tunnel was a straight shot. there were a handful of galleries on either side, but he quickly saw that each was a dead end - so there were no decisions to make. he was jogging now, slapping through pools of water, fearful that he was already too late. but it was noisy going, and it occurred to him that if solange heard him, he\\'d be dead. and, for a moment, he thought he was. a burst of submachine-gun fire exploded through the tunnel, obliterating the watery drip that was all around him. he froze, waiting for the pain to hit, then realized he wasn\\'t hurt. either solange had missed, or he was firing at something else. frank squinted into the darkness. he could hear solange, and a few steps farther on, he could see him. his back was to frank as he yanked at the iron door to the generating plant, whose lock he\\'d just riddled. the ingram was on the floor beside him, leaning against solange\\'s backpack, and frank could hear him, swearing in french as he jerked at the door. there wasn\\'t time to think. all solange had to do was get to the boiler feed pump, and that would be the end of it. however many guards there might be outside the plant, there wouldn\\'t be more than one or two workers inside. that was all it took to keep a generating plant running for a single shift. which meant there wasn\\'t anything to decide. it was a straight shot, for him and for solange. so he took off, running on his toes, wishing he had the 4.8 speed he\\'d had in high school, but knowing that he didn\\'t. there were twenty yards between them when solange heard his footsteps and, turning, saw frank bearing down on him like someone who should have had peterbilt written on his forehead.',\n",
       " 'it\\'s too far, frank thought. i\\'m too late. solange lunged for the ingram, and came up fast, fingers splayed on the barrel. it only took a second, less than a second, to shift the gun from one hand to the other, fumble for the trigger, raise the barrel, fire there was a flash of pain, and two loud pops as frank slammed into him. the gun jumped out of solange\\'s hands and the air burst from his mouth as he backpedaled into the wall, the back of his head thudding against the concrete. frank stepped back, then rolled forward with a looping overhead right that swept a row of teeth out of solange\\'s mouth. then he hit him again, and again, until, tiring of that, he drove his forehead into the bridge of solange\\'s nose. the guru was out on his feet when frank drove a forearm into the red pulp at the center of his face, sending a spray of blood flying through the air. then he spun him around and, taking him by the hair, slammed solange\\'s face into the edge of the door. once, twice, again. solange staggered away, as if he were looking for somewhere to fall. frank helped him, driving the edge of his hand as hard as he could into the knob at the back of solange\\'s neck. there was a crack like a popsicle stick snapping, and solange sprawled. frank could hear the police now. they were running down the tunnel. and a couple of steamfitters were standing in the doorway, gaping. frank took a step back, looking for a bit of room so he could put his foot through solange\\'s chest - when he realized that something was wrong. he was weaker than he should have been and, for some reason, he couldn\\'t seem to get his breath. and his chest was wet. soaking wet. he looked down. jesus christ, he thought. i\\'m dying... epilogue and, in fact, he almost bled to death. he\\'d been shot twice in the chest, and one of the bullets had tumbled, tearing through a tangle of blood vessels and soft tissues to lodge about a quarter of an inch from his spine. for nearly a week, then, he\\'d lain in the intensive care unit at columbia presbyterian hospital, breathing bottled oxygen and taking nourishment through a tube. after two operations, a doctor had finally pronounced him on the mend, and ordered him moved to a private room on the vip ward. which was good and bad. good, because the room was large, bright, and well-appointed, with a couch and sitting area next to a broad expanse of windows. which would be perfect for annie, if he was ever allowed visitors. but it was bad, too, because the room didn\\'t have a telephone. and it was strange, because he knew his insurance would never pay for a room like this - never in a million years - and knew that the hospital knew. also, and not incidentally, he wasn\\'t a very important person - except, perhaps, to annie. and yet... here he was. he asked his doctor what was going on, but all the doctor would say is, \"don\\'t worry about it. call it an upgrade.\" \"okay,\" frank replied, \"but do i get a phone with my upgrade?\"',\n",
       " 'this made the surgeon hesitate, \"well,\" he said, \"not just yet.\" \"and visitors?\" \"of course. very soon. when you\\'re stronger.\" this was fine with him, at first, because he was so zonked out on painkillers he didn\\'t know where he was half the time. but after four or five days he began to realize that something was wrong, or if not wrong, up. and he would probably have tried a wheelchair escape if the doctor hadn\\'t opened the door one morning and said, \"there\\'s someone here to see you.\" frank smiled and, still tender from the stitches in his chest, pushed himself up against the pillows. but his smile faded when he saw that it wasn\\'t annie who\\'d come to see him. it was an air force colonel named fitch. \"taylor fitch,\" he said, extending his hand. \"hi,\" frank replied, suddenly wary. they shook hands, and frank asked, \"what\\'s up?\" \"well,\" the colonel said, taking a piece of paper from his attache case, \"before we have our little talk, i was hoping you\\'d sign this. it\\'s just a technicality.\" he handed the paper to frank and, with a hopeful look, took a pen from his pocket. frank glanced at the page. it was a \"nondisclosure\" agreement. \"not for me,\" he said. \"thanks,\" and handed it back. the colonel returned the agreement to his attache case. then he sighed, but not heavily. \"it doesn\\'t matter.\" frank shrugged. \"i\\'m a journalist. i get paid to write. and it\\'s a good story.\" fitch nodded. \"hey - it\\'s a helluva story. no question.\" then he frowned. \"but you can\\'t publish it.\" frank squinted at him. \"do i know you?\" he asked. fitch shook his head. \"no.\" \"but i\\'ve seen your name.\" it was the colonel\\'s turn to feel uncomfortable. \"maybe,\" he suggested. \"i\\'m pretty active in scouting.\" frank shook his head. \"i don\\'t think that was it.\" \"well,\" fitch said, signaling a change in subject. \"that\\'s neither here nor there. i -\" frank turned his head toward the window, his brow furrowing. \"it was on a manifest,\" he said. \"what was?\" \"your name.\" he thought about it some more, and then it hit him. \"now i remember! you flew back from hammerfest with annie and gleason.\" \"who?\" fitch asked. \"neal gleason.\" \"i don\\'t think i know him,\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"yeah, right,\" frank replied, suppressing the little laugh that threatened to move through his chest like a razor blade. \"i don\\'t think any of us really knows mr. gleason. i don\\'t think any of us really wants to. but that\\'s who your seatmate was.\" he paused and cocked an eye at his visitor. \"i was gonna look you up, but — i got busy. is that really your uniform, or is it just a costume?\" fitch grinned. \"i\\'m in a reserve unit.\" frank looked away again. \"cia, huh?\" fitch shrugged. \"let me show you something,\" he said, removing a kind of plain-paper newsletter from his attache case. he handed it to frank. \"i turned the page down,\" he said. frank looked at the cover: the federal register. he opened it to page thirteen. \"you want me to read this?\" he asked. \"just so you get the drift,\" fitch replied. under the heading \"declaration of national emergency\" was a letter to congress from the president of the united states. because the actions and policies of the government of the democratic people\\'s republic of korea (dprk) continue to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the united states, a national emergency is declared, pursuant to the national emergencies act {50 u.s.c. 1622(d)}... frank looked up at his visitor. \"so?\" \"i\\'m trying to save you a lot of trouble.\" \"how\\'s that?\" \"well, before i get into that, i want you to understand that everyone\\'s very grateful for what you did. i mean that.\" \"thanks.\" \"but the other thing you need to understand is that a declaration of this kind gives the president, and by extension, me, some extraordinary powers. \"such as what?\" \"well, basically, it lets us do pretty much what we want to do. where matters relative to north korea are concerned, the constitution is pretty much suspended. if the need arose - and we\\'d be the ones to decide that - we could seize property and commodities, send troops abroad, institute martial law. the whole doctrine of habeas corpus goes out the window, which means we can hold anyone we want for as long as we want - without charging them with a crime.\" he paused, and looked around. \"you like your room?\" \"yeah,\" frank said. \"it\\'s nice.\" fitch smiled. \"good. i\\'m glad you like it. but that\\'s not all. if we have to, we can restrict travel, too, and if necessary, we can impose censorship.\" \"who\\'s \"we\"?\"',\n",

       " 'it should still be serviceable—if the ancient engineers had been correct in their calculations. he lifted the broad-brimmed panama from his head and wiped the sweat from his bald head, before replacing it. blinking through his thick round glasses, he walked toward the men. suddenly one of them stood and shouted something he couldn’t quite hear. the man, naked to the waist, lifted his pickax high in the air and beckoned to him. he broke into a run and hurried across the baking sand. “what have you found?” he asked when he eventually reached them. the stocky man who had wielded the pickax pointed into the hole they had dug. “father helix, look!” helix looked into the hole and his heart beat faster. there was the unmistakable square shape of a stone lintel; a small doorway. grabbing one of the men’s pickaxes, he stepped into the hole and began to chip away at the rock covering the lintel. but it wasn’t rock, only clay, designed to disguise the opening. after a few feverish blows he revealed the four-foot-tall doorway to the tunnel. “a flashlight! a flashlight!” he demanded. the brother with a curly, dust-covered black beard stood by an ill-tempered camel, laden down with panniers of equipment. he pulled out three large maglites. helix grabbed one of them and started into the opening. ahead, in the beam of the maglite, he could see what was effectively a steep ramp. it dropped at a forty-five-degree angle, with large ridges of rock carved into the floor like vicious, toothshaped steps. there was no handrail to steady him, but every ten yards or so the ramp turned back on itself so if he did fall he would be stopped by the turn. however, he had no intention of falling onto the jagged rocks underfoot. “be careful!” he called back to the two men following. “i don’t want any of you falling on me.” the air was stale and the incline made his thighs ache, but he was so focused on his descent that he ignored the discomfort. ten steps. turn. ten steps. turn.',\n",

       " 'he tried to count the number of turns to temper his mounting excitement, but lost track after forty. just as he was beginning to despair of ever reaching the bottom he saw something below him. he felt a tightness in his throat and turned off the flashlight. he could still see it, even this deep down in the rock. the light that twinkled like a beacon in the stygian darkness was unmistakable through the crack in the wall, and its white brilliance told him he wasn’t too late. with new energy rushing to his tired muscles, he switched on his flashlight and hurried down the last ten-yard ramp till he was in a small space, four foot by four. straight ahead was a stone door, beside it a heavy wooden lever. the lever was unnecessary, because the door had been riven from top to bottom, leaving a gap through which he could just squeeze. beyond the door he could see the pure white flame burning even more fiercely than he remembered it. helix paused then, waiting for the two men gasping with wonder and exertion behind him to arrive. “stay here!” he said. “when i’ve checked inside, i’ll call you.” then, ignoring the disappointment on their faces, he pushed through the gap. as he entered the vault of remembrance he almost stepped into an ugly crack, six inches wide, that ran all the way across the floor. the sacred flame issued from the other end of this fissure, illuminating a pile of charred remains that sat in the doorway between the vault and the far antechamber. helix knew that beyond that antechamber lay the remains of the sacred cavern where the sacred light had originally burned. he again thanked god for his deliverance when he remembered how he had escaped in the confusion of the cavern’s destruction. to his right was the covered recess containing the golden tabernacle and relics of christ. the secret door he had just come through had looked indistinguishable from the wall when he had last been in the vault. was it only four months ago that he had been here to collect the ritual oils and herbs with which to anoint maria’s body? he looked around the vault. the rope ladder was gone; only a charred trail of black marked where it had been. but',\n",

       " 'aside from the blackened ceiling and the remains in the far doorway, there was remarkably little damage. none of the artifacts on either side of the fissure had been harmed. only the mighty sword appeared to have been touched by what had happened here. for some reason it was lying on the floor in the middle of the vault, its blade severed at the very point it crossed the fissure. with hesitant steps he moved toward the burnt remains by the far door. he soon realized it was a man, and when he saw the ruby ring on one of the clenched black fingers he knew who it must be. grimacing, he bent down and removed the ring of leadership, rubbing it on his shirt. after removing most of the soot he stared with wonder at the blood—red gemstone, its inner fire glowing like embers. the cross—shaped mounting of white gold had been superficially blackened, but was otherwise undamaged. with trembling hands he placed the ring on his own finger and was gratified when it fit perfectly. a rush of emotion suddenly welled up inside him. when he had become champion of the primary imperative, he had been briefed on succeeding ezekiel de la croix. he had been shown all the mechanisms of leadership: the brotherhood’s numbered accounts, the security boxes containing the ancient maps, the roll call of members, and the original documentation of the rules and objectives of the brotherhood. but with the chaos four months ago he hadn’t really felt that his succession had been legitimized, not until this simple act of placing the ruby ring on his finger. this digital coronation symbolized the passing of the mantle of leadership to him, and brought home the full impact of the duty and honor that now rested with him. he removed his thick glasses and rubbed the dusty sleeve of his cotton robe across his eyes before he realized they were filled with tears. composing himself, he started to straighten up, preparing to usher in the two brothers waiting patiently beyond the fractured door. then he noticed the smaller pile of ash next to ezekiel’s charred body, and an inch square of white cloth beside it. his mouth went dry.',\n",

       " 'he had been so engrossed in the ring and his leadership of the brotherhood of the second coming that he had momentarily forgotten the very purpose of that high office. kneeling on the stone floor, he studied the pile of ash. composed of black planes and contours, it looked like unraveled folds of charred fabric. he touched it and the pile collapsed into dust, all semblance of structure lost. then he picked up the inch square of white cloth, one edge browned by flame. with exaggerated calmness he slowly brought the fabric to his nose. it smelled predominantly of smoke, but he immediately recognized another smell: the cloying aroma of the ritual herbs and oils. this square of cloth was all that remained of the shroud he himself had helped prepare four months ago. but as for the body that had been wrapped in it, there was no sign.\\n']"
